summary:
- "COVID-19 has moved faster and had rates of mortality higher than what were initially forecast. All departments within large hospital systems have had to learn lessons and adapt in real time to the crisis. We share our experience and what we have learned as it pertains to this pandemic. Hope that it aides, guides and influences other departments of physical medicine and rehabilitation regarding their potential roles and areas of growth during this time. The crisis has been a major concern for the medical establishment in New York City."
