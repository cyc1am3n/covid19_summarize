summary:
- "the COVID-19 crisis could trigger a critical juncture for several institutional arrangements in Canada. But vast differences in fiscal and economic circumstances make federal arrangements difficult to design. Intergovernmental power dynamics and the principle of provincial autonomy are particularly important considerations in thinking about fiscal federalism. This research note combines insights from historical institutionalism with recent economic and fiscal projections to explore avenues for reform in response to the crisis."

We argue that intergovernmental power dynamics and the principle of provincial autonomy are particularly important considerations in thinking about fiscal federalism post COVID-19"
