summary:
- "Coronavirus Anxiety Scale is a brief mental health screener to identify possible cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products. The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of >/= 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity was a 5-item scale based on 775 adults to identify probable cases of anxiety."

original:
- "Mental health concerns of people impacted by the coronavirus pandemic have not been adequately addressed. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity. Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products. The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of >/= 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity). These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice."
