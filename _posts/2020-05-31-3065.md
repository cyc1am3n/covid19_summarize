summary:
- "SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Al... CoV receptor binding domain, was developed and made under current bad manufacturing practices. It was developed in 2016 and developed under current high-tech practices in 2016. The protein was known as the RBD2-19-n1 protein."
