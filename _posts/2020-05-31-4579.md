summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less frequent and severe than adults. Age-related ACE2 receptor expression, lymphocyte count and trained immunity might be the keystone to reveal children's secret. Epidemiological evidence show that SARS is less frequently and severe in children. Ethnic evidence shows SARS CoV-2 infections in children are less frequent than adults and less severe than adult. Children's secrets may be revealed by age-related receptor expression and lymphocyte counts."
