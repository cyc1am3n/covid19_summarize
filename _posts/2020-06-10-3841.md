summary:
- "in the USA and around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived as the population was fighting a devastating opioid overdose epidemic. Urgent and decisive action is needed to protect particularly vulnerable populations, such as those with opioid use disorder, to prevent a compounding effect on public health. Emergency action is required to protect vulnerable populations. Those with opioid misuse disorder are urged to prevent compounding effects on health care. Action is needed in the U.S. to prevent overdoses."
