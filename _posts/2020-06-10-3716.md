summary:
- "to determine the transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Iran in 2020. We estimated the reproduction number as 4.4 (95% CI 3.9-4.9) by using a generalized growth model. The reproduction number decreased to 1.55 after social distancing interventions were implemented. Reproduction number decreased from 1.55 to 1.3-8.1. To determine transmission potential, we estimated the reproducing number as 1.55. Using epidemic doubling time, we used a growth model and 3."

The reproduction number decreased to 1.55 after social distancing interventions were implemented."
