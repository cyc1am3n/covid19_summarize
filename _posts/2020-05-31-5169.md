summary:
- "the basic reproductive number of 2019-nCoV is higher than R0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. COVID-19 presents with asymptomatic infections, with potential to propagate and perpetuate this epidemic. The amino acid sequence in the ACE2 receptor responsible for 2019-NCoV binding in farm animals and cats has only a few exchanges compared with the human receptor. This suggests that the species barrier for virus transmission is small."

original:
- "The basic reproductive number (R0) of 2019-nCoV is higher than R0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 presents with asymptomatic infections, with potential to propagate and perpetuate this epidemic. 2019-nCoV isolated from patients shows limited sequence diversity, suggesting that the interspecies transmission event was very recent and that the source of the virus was focused, possibly a point-source event. The amino acid sequence in the ACE2 receptor responsible for 2019-nCoV binding in farm animals and cats has only a few exchanges compared with the human receptor, suggesting that the species barrier for virus transmission is small."
