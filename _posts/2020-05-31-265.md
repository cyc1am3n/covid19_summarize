summary:
- "a Maternal-Fetal medicine physician moved out of our shared bedroom of nearly 10 years on 3/22/2020. She was acutely aware of the coming COVID-19 crisis and its potential ramifications on the health of her family, friends, patients and community. He is trained to function well in emergencies, and in this case, it was a quick and seemingly logical next-step to sleep separately."

original:
- "I moved out of our shared bedroom of nearly 10 years on 3/22/2020. It was not a difficult decision as we have two young children and wondered what would happen if both of us became ill at the same time. As a Maternal-Fetal medicine physician in New York City, I was acutely aware of the coming COVID-19 crisis, and its potential ramifications on the health of my family, friends, patients and community. I am trained to function well in emergencies, and in this case, it was a quick and seemingly logical next-step to sleep separately."
