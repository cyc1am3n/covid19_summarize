summary:
- "Covid-19 cases could soon overshoot the capacity of the healthcare system. A suppression of the virus remains the best solution for the crisis. Supply will suffer as long the virus persists. Until then, demand side measures will not cure the epidemic. Coordinated measures for business that ensure compliance and European debt instruments may be part of a strategy to solve the crisis. The German Society for Epidemiology has warned that the number of cases may soon oversoot healthcare system capacity. This may be true even if Germany follows the 'flatten-the-curve approach to reduce infection rates could be true."

This may be true even if Germany follows the 'flatten-the-curve'- approach to reduce infection rates. A suppression of the virus remains the best solution for the crisis. Supply will suffer as long the virus persists. Until then, demand side measures will not cure the epidemic. Coordinated measures for business that ensure compliance and European debt instruments may be part of a strategy to solve the crisis."
