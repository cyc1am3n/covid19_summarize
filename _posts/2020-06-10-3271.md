summary:
- "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBS blockers. ACE2 receptors serve as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 virions in the lungs. Patients who take ARBS may be at increased risk of severe disease outcomes due to infection. Infusions in experimental animals increase the number of ACEI receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation. The ACE II receptors are a binding site for a virion in the lung."
