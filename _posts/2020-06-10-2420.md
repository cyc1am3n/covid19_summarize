summary:
- "the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19 infection. In approximately 14% of the patients affected, the infection progresses with the development of pneumonia that requires mechanical ventilation. Mesenchymal stem cell secretome could offer new therapeutic approach in treating the infection due to the broad pharmacological effects it shows. Immunmodulatory, regenerative, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties."

original:
- "From the end of 2019, the world population has been faced the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 infection. In approximately 14% of the patients affected by the novel coronavirus, the infection progresses with the development of pneumonia that requires mechanical ventilation. At the moment, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive. In our opinion, mesenchymal stem cell secretome could offer a new therapeutic approach in treating COVID-19 pneumonia, due to the broad pharmacological effects it shows, including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, regenerative, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties."
