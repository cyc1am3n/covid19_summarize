summary:
- "the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. We retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab and blood. All of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage. 8 of the 11 patients with the virus-positive was in severe clinical stage, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. The presence of virus RNA was confirmed in extra-pulmonary sites."

original:
- "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites."
