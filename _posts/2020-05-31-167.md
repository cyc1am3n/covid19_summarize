summary:
- "India has mandated lockdowns of all but essential services. Many research projects have been interrupted because scientists cannot access their equipment or workspace. Despite stringent laws preventing untreated effluent discharge in rivers and streams, a substantial fraction of industrial waste ends up in nearby water bodies or groundwater. Environmental quality data dating from before industrialization are rarely available. Sediments deposited before the industrialization, often used as baseline data, are marred by physical and chemical changes that have taken place over time."

original:
- "To minimize the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), countries such as India have mandated lockdowns of all but essential services. Many research projects have been interrupted because scientists cannot access their equipment or workspace. However, with almost all industrial businesses shuttered, scientists have an opportunity to collect vital data. Despite India's stringent laws preventing untreated effluent discharge in rivers and streams, a substantial fraction of industrial waste ends up in nearby water bodies or groundwater. Therefore, while industries are operating as usual, it is impossible to collect baseline data. Environmental quality data dating from before industrialization are rarely available. Sediments deposited before the industrialization, often used as baseline data, are marred by physical and chemical changes that have taken place over time. With the complete shutdown of industrial operations, the effluent discharge is negligible. The water quality of nearby streams, if tested systematically during the lockdown period, could serve as a baseline against which scientists can subsequently track the point source of water pollution."
