summary:
- "the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown. Public health and medicinal measures will be needed to contain spreading of the virus. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations. Other key drug targets share a strikingly high homology to SARS-CoV."

original:
- "With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. While little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its more well-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations which may hamper efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RdRp and 3CLpro, share a strikingly high (>95%) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest 4 potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts??and hope to help develop broad spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics."
