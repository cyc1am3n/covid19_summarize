summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects principally the respiratory tract. Recent studies described the disease could present a broader clinical spectrum from the absence of any symptoms to heart (1) , digestive (2) or Ear-Nose-Throat (including anosmia and ageusia) (3) manifestations. Here we report two cases of peculiar skin manifestation. This is based on a recent study."
