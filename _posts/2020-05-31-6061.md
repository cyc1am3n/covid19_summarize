summary:
- "a new coronavirus infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and the information promptly released. In this article, we discuss possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals. This article discusses the possible functional implications of the virus in viral cycle. We discuss its potential implications for antiviral development."

original:
- "In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and the genomic information promptly released. Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs. In this article, we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals."
