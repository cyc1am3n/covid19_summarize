summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of the cause of the outbreaks is crucial. We describe an epidemiological investigation that established links between three clusters of COVID19.. SARS-CoV-2 serological assays established link between clusters. The link between the two clusters is key for effective diagnosis of the disease."

We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19."
