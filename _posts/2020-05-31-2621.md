summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has now spread in almost every country in the world. We propose a standardized approach to optimize the use of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19. The study focuses on equipment, procedure, classification, and data sharing. Severse acute respiration syndrome has spread in nearly every country. It is the first time that lung ultrasound has been shown to be useful. Study aims to optimize use of ultrasound in patient with new disease."

original:
- "Growing evidence is showing the usefulness of lung ultrasound in patients with the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has now spread in almost every country in the world. In this study, we share our experience and propose a standardized approach to optimize the use of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19. We focus on equipment, procedure, classification, and data sharing."
