original:
- "While it remains much too early to determine precisely how alcohol use might affect risk for or progression of COVID-19, any efforts to connect the dots from past alcohol research would suggest it wise for nondrinkers and low-risk drinkers to maintain that status during this public health crisis. It's already known that disaster can result in increased alcohol consumption based on the work of Deborah Hasin, Ph.D., after 9/11 (see ?Alcohol and isolation: Experts comment on drinking behavior during COVID-19,? ADAW March 30; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32670)."
