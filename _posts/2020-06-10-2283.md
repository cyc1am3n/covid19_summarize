summary:
- "COVID-19 is a zoonotic illness first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) COV-2 infected patients can be asymptomatic carriers or present with mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Imaging, including Computed Tomography, is not recommended to screen/diagnose COV-19 infections, but plays an important role in management of these patients."

original:
- "COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-19) is a zoonotic illness first reported in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is now officially a global pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). The infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 infected patients can be asymptomatic carriers or present with mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Imaging, including Computed Tomography (CT) is not recommended to screen/diagnose COVID-19 infections, but plays an important role in management of these patients, and to rule out alternative diagnoses or coexistent diseases. In our multicenter case series, we outline the clinical presentations and illustrate the most common imaging manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19."
