summary:
- "I have been researching coronaviruses for more than forty years. This viewpoint summarizes some of the major findings made before the SARS epidemic and how they inform current research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Coronavires have been found in the past 40 years and have been a part of a long-term research effort. The research is based on the new SARS CoV-2, which is a newly emerged sARS-coV 2. It is the first time I've spent more than 40 years researching the major research for over 40 years in the U.S. research."
