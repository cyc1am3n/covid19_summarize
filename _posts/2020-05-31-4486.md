summary:
- "We present a simple projection with data up to 21/03/2020 of the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases per day in Chile using data from the Ministry of Health. We estimate over 100 000 cases at 120 days consistent with the data recorded to date. Use an exponential total case model to represent (using a parameter) the daily effort to reduce a high initial daily growth rate. This model is based on different numerical scenarios of feasibility and desired future prevalence. Using a cubic adjustment model, we estimate more cases in Chile a projection of the data. up to 20/03/2020. Data."

original:
- "We present a straightforward projection with data up to 21/03/2020 of the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases per day in Chile using data from the Ministry of Health. Assuming an arithmetical growth in the second variation of the data, we present a cubic adjustment model in which we estimate over 100 000 cases at 120 days consistent with the data recorded to date. Furthermore, we use an exponential total case model to represent (using a parameter) the daily effort to reduce a high initial daily growth rate. We simulate this model with different numerical scenarios of feasibility and desired future prevalence."
