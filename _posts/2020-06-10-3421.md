summary:
- "COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global public health emergency. We performed genetic analyses of eighty-six complete or near-complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2. This revealed many mutations and deletions on coding and non-coding regions. These observations provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of this novel coronanavirus, which has been declared a public health crisis."
