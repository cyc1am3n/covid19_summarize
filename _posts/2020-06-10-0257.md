summary:
- "anesthesia professionals should designate and maintain clean and dirty areas in their work environment. Patients should decolonize using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, two doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision. End users need timely feedback of infectious data collected by surveillance of classic pathogen transmission."

original:
- "We describe an evidence-based approach for optimization of infection control and operating room management during the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization. Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C).1 Clinician components include placing alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) on the intravenous (IV) pole to the left of the provider and utilization of double glove techniques during induction.2 In addition, a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag should be located on the IV pole to the right of the provider, and all contaminated instruments placed in the bag (i.e. laryngoscope blades and handles) and securely closed. Anesthesia professionals should designate and maintain clean and dirty areas in their work environment. After the induction of anesthesia, we recommend providers wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol, using a top down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce the bioburden. We endorse cleaning operating rooms with use of UV-C lights.3 Patients should decolonize using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, two doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision, and a chlorhexidine mouth rinse.4 All IV line ports must be closed and use vigorous hub disinfection.5 Lastly, end users need timely feedback of infectious data collected by surveillance of classic pathogen transmission.6"
