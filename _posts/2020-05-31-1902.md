summary:
- "Data are emerging on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mother and baby. Many guidelines on pregnancy management have been released [2-6], but the actual journey to establishing an obstetric unit can be challenging. The present article describes the stepwise informed approach that was taken to rapidly establish a unit for suspected patients within existing resources. It follows that pregnancy and childbirth will also be affected. Data is emerging about the effects of the infection on mothers and baby [1]."

Data are emerging on the consequences of the infection on mother and baby [1]. Many guidelines on pregnancy management during the pandemic have been released [2-6], but the actual journey to establishing an obstetric unit can be challenging. The present article describes the stepwise informed approach that was taken to rapidly establish a unit for suspected COVID-19 patients within existing resources, and the experience of delivering the first pregnant patient with confirmed COVID-19 in India."
