summary:
- "GE Healthcare anaesthetic machines had a ventilator gas-driven using oxygen. This resulted in a large amount of wasted oxygen in the ventilator. We have 52 machines which form part of our plan to increase our ITU capacity. Our anasthetic department has 52 machines. It is part of a plan for the COVID-19 pandemic. During our preparedness we identified that our GE healthcare anaesthesthetic machine was gas driven."
