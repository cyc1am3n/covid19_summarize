original:
- "Major therapeutic developments have been achieved in the field of thrombotic and hemorrhagic diseases over the last decade. These include the development and validation of four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) indicated for numerous thrombotic disorders, both arterial and venous [1]. It also involves new haemostatic agents for hemophilia patients, in particular Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX) concentrates with extended half-life (EHL) [2;3] and a bispecific antibody mimicking the action of FVIII (Emicizumab) [4;5]."
