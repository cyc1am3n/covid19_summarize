original:
- "Sir, I wrote to you in 2019 about the impact of mental health disorders amongst dental patients. With the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the current Public Health Emergency, COVID-19, it is just as important as ever to also recognise and manage the mental wellbeing of professionals in healthcare. Such an unprecedented situation is understandably likely to trigger feelings of stress and anxiety. Concerns over physical health, uncertainty over redeployment, and training and employment insecurities are just a few of the many difficulties that members of the dental and medical community are facing. Healthcare professionals are also challenged to find a balance between managing their own physical and mental health, and that of the patients they are treating."
