summary:
- "many challenges and obstacles have been presented for health care leadership. Priorities are rapidly shifting, anxiety and fear are present, and knowing where to focus support is a challenge. As I sit and reflect on lessons learned throughout this experience, I can't help but continue to focus on frontline leadership and their important role in this entire process. The organization received our first presumptive positive COVID-19 patient, and throughout our journey, many challenges are presented."
