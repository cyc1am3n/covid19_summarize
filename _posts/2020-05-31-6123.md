summary:
- "the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan, a central city in China. In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of CoVs. This review will help understand the biology and potential risk of different coVs that exist in richness in wildlife such as bats. The research will help explain the risks posed to public health. It will also describe diseases caused by different CoV is a new virus in China is another warning of the risk of the virus causing a virus outbreak in patients."
