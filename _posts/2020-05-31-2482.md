summary:
- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus is unknown. A learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through shared learning and experience across transplant centers. This perspective paper reviews current COVID19 epidemiology, diagnosis and potential therapies."

original:
- "The full impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus, on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. This perspective paper reviews the following: current COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis and potential therapies; care considerations unique to HCT patients; and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through facilitating shared learning and experience across transplant centers."
