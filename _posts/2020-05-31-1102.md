summary:
- "Flow physics plays a key role in nearly every facet of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative measures such as face masks, hand washing, ventilation of indoor environments and even social distancing. This includes the generation and aerosolization of virus-laden respiratory droplets from a host, its airborne dispersion and deposition on surfaces, as well as the subsequent inhalation of these bioaerosols by unsuspecting recipients. Flies physics is key to the development of a critical role in virtually every part of the. pandemie."

Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative measures such as the use of face masks, hand washing, ventilation of indoor environments and even social distancing. This article summarizes what we know and, more importantly, what we need to learn about the science underlying these issues so that we are better prepared to tackle the next outbreak of COVID-19 or a similar disease."
