Surgeons need to develop critical care management concepts and focus on the critical care support equipment associated with the outbreak. Some suggestions are put forward for the standardized training of resident surgeons to cultivate compound talents. This artical can lead to the thinking of how to participate in the emergency medical rescue of infectious diseases among surgeons and provide some enlightenment for future surgical education. The surgical staff are overworked and under tremendous psychological pressure is a newly a new epidemic, COVId-19."

original:
- "As a newly epidemic, COVID-19 with a concentrated outbreak poses a great challenge to medical treatment. The severe and critical patients are complex complicatied with the psychological problems, and the medical staff are overworked and under tremendous psychological pressure. The surgeon participated in emergency medical rescue could provide professional treatment for the patients combined with surgical diseases, specialized training for the non-surgeon crew, to reduce surgical-related mortality. With the advantages of good team consciousness, strong aseptic concept and good psychological quality, the surgeons can quickly adapt to and carry out rescue work under the premise of good self-protection. Surgeons need to develop critical care management concepts and focus on the critical care support equipment associated with the outbreak. Some suggestions are put forward for the standardized training of resident surgeons to cultivate compound talents. It is hoped that this artical can lead to the thinking of how to participate in the emergency medical rescue of infectious diseases among surgeons and provide some enlightenment for future surgical education."
