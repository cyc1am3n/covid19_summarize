summary:
- "the pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals. An effective and approved vaccine for the virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile. The state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically."

original:
- "Global health is facing the most dangerous situation regarding the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome called coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is widely known as the abbreviated COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals (data until 27 April 2020). The pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to be originated from the Wuhan Province in China. Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile. This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs. The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19."
