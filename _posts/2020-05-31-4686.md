summary:
- "the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the positive of etiological test. The current test cost long time, and have high false negative rate. We suggested that the diagnosis should be diagnosed as 3 types: suspected case, clinical diagnosed case, and definite diagnosed case. Defected case should be identified as suspected case and clinical diagnosis. CoVID19 should be treated as suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases, and clinically definite cases."
