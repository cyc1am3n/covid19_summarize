summary:
- "airway management in COVID-19 patient is a point of risk concentration for providers, patients and medical systems. We want to highlight two points arising from our reading of these guidelines. First, failure to minimise aggregate risk poses a strategic threat to our medical systems, and two, it is critical to include the risk of mental bandwidth saturation as a risk for contamination. A simple, qualitative, mental model explains how risk of provider exposure is generated during airways management."

original:
- "Airway management in the COVID-19 patient is a point of risk concentration for providers, patients and medical systems. Time is of the essence if medical systems are to turn the tide of collapse seen in Wuhan, Italy, Spain and now New York. We would like to highlight two points arising from our reading of these guidelines; first, failure to minimise aggregate airway management risk poses a strategic threat to our medical systems, and two, it is critical to include the risk of mental bandwidth saturation as a risk for contamination. In addition, we offer a simple, qualitative, mental model that explains how the risk of provider exposure is generated during airway management."
