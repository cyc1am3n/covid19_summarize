summary:
- "the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the urgency for applying clinical pharmacology and model-informed drug development in clinical trials. We have a responsibility for adaptive evidence synthesis with a Totality of Evidence mindset in this race against time across biomedical research, clinical practice, drug development and regulation. The unprecedented challenges highlighted the urgent need for maximizing value of information from impacted non-COVID19 trials, he said. More than ever, we have an adaptive evidence-based pandemie highlighted the urgency of the COVID-19 pandesmic highlights the urgency.."

original:
- "The unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the urgency for applying clinical pharmacology and model-informed drug development in (i) dosage optimization for COVID-19 therapies, (ii) approaching therapeutic dilemmas in clinical trial settings, and (iii) maximizing value of information from impacted non-COVID-19 trials. More than ever, we have a responsibility for adaptive evidence synthesis with a Totality of Evidence mindset in this race against time across biomedical research, clinical practice, drug development and regulation."
