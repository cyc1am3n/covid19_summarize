summary:
- "Several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. Antimalarial chloroquine, favipiravir, co-administered darunavir and umifenovir were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS CoV-2 effects."

original:
- "Here we report on the most recent updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS CoV-2 coronavirus, also referred to as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19). In particular, several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to find other more specific antiviral strategies."
