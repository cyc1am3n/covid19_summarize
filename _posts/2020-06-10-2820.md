summary:
- "?fear, rumours and stigma? are key challenges accompanying COVID-19. The convergence of its framing as a ?foreign virus? and an ?infodemic? ignited this fear and stigma. Blaming epidemics on a foreign ?other? is not a new phenomenon. We can leverage our four decades of HIV research to understand and address the stigma associated with the virus. This is not new phenomenon, says the U.N.."

original:
- "Stigma targeting people associated with COVID-19, particularly persons of Asian descent, has been reported in media spanning diverse global contexts. The United Nations described that ?fear, rumours and stigma? are key challenges accompanying COVID-19. The convergence of its framing as a ?foreign virus? and an ?infodemic? ignited this fear and stigma. This is not a new phenomenon. Blaming epidemics on a foreign ?other? is a recurring historic narrative. We can leverage our four decades of HIV research to understand and address COVID-19 stigma."
