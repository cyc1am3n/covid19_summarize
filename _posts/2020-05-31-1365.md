summary:
- "multidisciplinary conferences are an important component of head and neck oncologic care. Virtual MDC allows for improved collaboration between providers at distant sites and proper allocation of health care resources in a time of crisis. A virtual MDC is feasible to design and implement in large academic medical center with multiple satellite hospitals. Multidisciplinary conferences allow for better collaboration between distant sites. The multidisciplinary conference is a key component of oncological care including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. When approached systematically, a virtual."
