summary:
- "UL-DVT in 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 require continuous positive airway pressure with hood and early adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis. Little or nothing is known about the correlation between the upper limbs deep vein thrombosis and SARS CoV-2. We describe the increased risk of UL in three patients. The study is based on a study of the correlation. It is not known if there is a correlation between UL and UL. There is no known about a patient with a deep veins is associated with the higher risk of deep vein vein."
