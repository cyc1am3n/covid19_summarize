summary:
- "TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cell line is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is useful for isolating and propagating SARS CoV-2. This makes it useful for propagating and isoling the virus. Our results show that a novel betacoronavirus is currently spreading across many countries globally. The virus caused a large respiratory outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019."

original:
- "A novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused a large respiratory outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is currently spreading across many countries globally. Here, we show that a TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cell line is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, making it useful for isolating and propagating SARS-CoV-2. Our results reveal that, in common with SARS- and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection is enhanced by TMPRSS2."
