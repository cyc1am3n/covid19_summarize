original:
- "With the pandemic of COVID-19, the routine work of surgeons has been reduced to release resources to critical care and other functions. This is necessary and right, in order to protect the health of our communities now. As a consequence, many of us who undertake clinical research have seen our work suspended. With a rich portfolio of colorectal research, this includes studies such as ROSSINI2, PITSTOP, & MASH, and has delayed the start of other important studies such as ELF 2 and Damascus]. When we return to something akin to normality, we shall be looking to re-establish the studies in a timely manner. Funders have generally been flexible with regards to the disruption and have provided guidance on how the disruption might be managed1. There is no doubt that they may be asked to provide additional support for studies in progress, which may impact future funding opportunities."
