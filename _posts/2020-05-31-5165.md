summary:
- "Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity. We could learn from SARS and MERS. The literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo. This review aims to clarify the potential for the use of the agent."

original:
- "In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID-19."
