Mauricio Navarrette: Antimicrobial mouthrinses, particularly chlorhexidine products, have antiviral action. He says the evidence base for their use in preventing or reducing transmission of coronavirus infection is not in place. No evidence base is in place for antiseptic rinses, he says, but the lipid outer layer of toothpaste should be strengthened by the public should be used for two minute twice daily.

original:
- "The recommendation to tooth brush with toothpaste for two minutes twice a day, I believe, should be reinforced by the dental profession, the media and the government and its advisors. Although, we may assume such oral hygiene practices are already the norm, this is certainly not the case, particularly for those individuals who coincidentally are most at risk of contracting COVID-19. This includes the elderly, particularly in nursing and retirement homes, where hygiene practices often depend on carers. Finally, I would address the idea of using antimicrobial mouthrinses, particularly chlorhexidine products. Unfortunately, the evidence base for their use in preventing or reducing transmission of coronavirus infection is not in place. Indeed, although some antiseptic rinses, including chlorhexidine, have antiviral action, the lipid outer layer of coronavirus would probably protect against such agents"
