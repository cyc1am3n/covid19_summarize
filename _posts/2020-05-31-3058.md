summary:
- "Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time. A number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing. The development of a vaccine using different approaches is under investigation. SARS-CoV2 has emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission. It is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases."

original:
- "In December 2019 a new human coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, which is known as SARS-CoV2. The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure. The virus is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases. The origin of SARS-CoV2 lies in the bat coronavirus pool and has now emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission. Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing. The development of a vaccine using different approaches is also under investigation.Considering the high number of cases and mortality rates of up to 9% there is an urgent need for action. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on human coronaviruses with a strong focus on the current data on SARS-CoV2. Due to the daily changing level of knowledge, the article reflects the status up to 21 March 2020."
