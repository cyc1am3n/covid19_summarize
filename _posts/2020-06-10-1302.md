summary:
- "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic situation is posing a challenge to global health and economy. Early accurate diagnosis acts as a key role in fighting against the disease. However, it might be missed diagnosis because of false-negative tests for the insufficient sensitivity of single means to detect the virus or co-infection with other viruses."

original:
- "The pandemic situation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a great challenge to global health and economy. Early accurate diagnosis acts as a key role in fighting against the disease. However, it might be missed diagnosis because of false-negative tests for the insufficient sensitivity of single means to detect SARS-CoV-2 or co-infection with other viruses, which will affect clinical management decisions, as well as the control of the epidemic. Therefore, broader viral tests should be given to the suspected COVID-19 patients. Here, we mainly discuss the existing diagnostic methods of COVID-19. In summary, combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19. Of note, this work systematically illustrates the various diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 in a comprehensive manner. More importantly, our work offers practical options for diagnosis of COVID-19. This may effectively help clinicians make correct decisions and win a victory over SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible."
