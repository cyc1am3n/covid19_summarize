summary:
- "pneumonia has been poorly reported in solid-organ transplanted patients. Prognosis is uncertain and best management unclear. Patients should be readily informed about new cases of Covid-19 pneumonia. 61-year-old kidney transplant recipient was hospitalized and later received a diagnosis. The infection was successfully managed with the use of hydroxychloroquine and a single administration of Tocilizumab after immunosuppression reduction."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia has been poorly reported in solid-organ transplanted patients; prognosis is uncertain and best management unclear. We describe the case of a 61-year-old kidney transplant recipient with several co-morbidities who was hospitalized and later received a diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia; the infection was successfully managed with the use of hydroxychloroquine and a single administration of Tocilizumab, after immunosuppression reduction; the patient did not require mechanical ventilation. During the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, transplant clinicians should be readily informed about new cases of Covid-19 pneumonia in solid-organ transplant recipients, with focus on therapeutic strategies employed and their outcome."
