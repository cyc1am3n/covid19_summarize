original:
- "The pandemic of coronavirus we are facing all around the world is changing our way of life and will undoubtedly bring us many challenges that will suppress socioeconomic effects1 . We could number many impacts related to public health nutrition, from hunger, nutritional insecurity to increasing consumption of ultraprocessed foods, development of nutritional disorders and obesity. However, there is a habit that we cannot overlook in our actual reality: the consumption of away-from-home food (AFHF). The increase in this habit is well recognized in many developed and developing countries. In recent years, new alternatives of access to foods prepared away from home have emerged, such as apps for home-delivery foods. Due to coronavirus outbreak more people are relying on these food delivery apps and other delivery services2 . In scientific literature, there is a discussion about the definition of AFHF, whether it should be based on the place where food is prepared or on the place where food is consumed. If we define AFHF based on the place where food is consumed, during the isolation period due to coronavirus pandemic, the majority of people will not eat away from home. However, it is important to consider changes related to the manner food is being ordered during the pandemic. Although we do not have evidence regarding the increase in home food-delivery services, many companies are hiring employees to handle food delivery demand2, 3,4 . Therefore, if we define AFHF based on the place food is prepared we will have a more reliable evaluation of this habit around the world."
