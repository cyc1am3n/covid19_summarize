summary:
- "the COVID-19 virus was isolated from a patient in South Korea. The virus was identified by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing of the full-length of the genome. There were 53.9% of cases who were males, with 16 cases in patients who had traveled abroad. Most secondary infected cases were from family members outside the family home (66.7%) and within a family home (75%) [6]. The incubation period was 4."

original:
- "In the current issue of Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, 3 studies are presented dealing with COVID-19. A study by Kim et al, analyzed the genetic information of the COVID-19 virus isolated from a patient in South Korea. The virus was identified by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing of the full-length of the genome [5]. In an interim report by the COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center of the KCDC, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in 28 cases in South Korea were reported. There were 53.9% of cases who were males, with 16 cases in patients who had traveled abroad, of which 11 cases (39.3%) were from Wuhan, China, and 12 of the remaining cases were believed to have been infected in South Korea. The incubation period was 4.8 days. Most secondary infected cases were from family members outside the family home (66.7%) and within the family home (75%) [6]."
