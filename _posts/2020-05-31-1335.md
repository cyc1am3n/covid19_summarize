original:
- "This study was conducted for predicting preventive behaviours of healthcare workers (HCW) towards Covid-19 based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). This cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted on 761 HCW in Hamadan, Iran, using multi-stage random sampling. The preventive behaviours against COVID-19 among HCW were assessed at a relatively desirable level. Based on the PMT, threat and coping appraisal were predictors of protection motivation to conduct COVID-19 preventive behaviours (P<0.001). The intention was also predictive of COVID-19 preventive behaviours (P<0.001). Consideration of personnel's self-efficacy and their knowledge regarding the effectiveness of protective behaviours in designing staff training programs are recommended."
