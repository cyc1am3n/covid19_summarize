summary:
- "the SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China. The virus is recognised as a potentially zoonotic virus. We are utilizing the One Health concept to understand the emergence of the virus, as well as point to some possible control strategies that might reduce the spread of the disease across the globe. This would be possible; containment of such virus could be possible. It is reported in people on inhabited continents and is reported to be in people."

The virus shares a high level of identity with some bat coronaviruses and is recognised as a potentially zoonotic virus. We are utilizing the One Health concept to understand the emergence of the virus, as well as to point to some possible control strategies that might reduce the spread of the virus across the globe; thus, containment of such virus would be possible."
