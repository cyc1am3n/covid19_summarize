title: "PAP therapy increases the risk of transmission of COVID-19"
link: "https://doi.org/10.3949/ccjm.87a.ccc003"
author:

summary:
- "positive airway pressure therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19. Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients. Recommendations for sleep clinics and sleep laboratory activities are also discussed. PAP devices are used as a substitute for ventilation. The emergency use of the devices is also discussed as well as the emergency use."

original:
- "Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Recommendations for sleep clinics and sleep laboratory activities are also discussed as well as the emergency use of PAP devices as a substitute for ventilation."
