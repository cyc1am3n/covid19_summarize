original:
- "There is currently no proven effective therapy for COVID-19. Without wishing to be exhaustive, the drugs most studied in this regard are presented below. Each of the listed therapeutic options is considered experimental at this stage. However, given the severe public health implications of the epidemic and the potentially fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care unit, their use 'off-label' should be considered. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 685-688."
