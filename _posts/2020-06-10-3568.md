summary:
- "information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors. There were more cases fatalities among COVID patients without comorbidities than in the reference cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources. Health sector should prepare to prepare for a high exploitation of ventilation. More cases were fatal among COVD-19 patients without complications than in reference cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. Information on disease seriousness is crucial to assessing disease severity is crucial in preparation. a reference cohort is critical for healthcare sector."

original:
- "Information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (transmissibility, disease seriousness, impact) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors. We present a simple approach to assess disease seriousness, creating a reference cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. First comparisons exposed a higher rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation. There were more case fatalities among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities than in the reference cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources."
