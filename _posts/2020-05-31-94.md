Techniques for inpatient management may vary due to special precautions to avoid the aerosolization."

original:
- "No specific data exists regarding management of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are infected with COVID-19. Based on expert opinion, strategies for outpatient management include use of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor to reduce pulmonary exacerbations, telemedicine, adherence to prescribed regimens, prompt and aggressive treatment of CF exacerbations, and communication about COVID-19 with patients with CF. Strategies for inpatient management may vary due to special precautions to avoid the aerosolization of COVID-19 with the use of nebulized medications and other therapies."
