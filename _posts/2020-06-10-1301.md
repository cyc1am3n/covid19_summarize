summary:
- "Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for surgery. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and MERS outbreaks were also reviewed. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs."

original:
- "The Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis and Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of Otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. RESULTS Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any Otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs. CONCLUSION We summarize current best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologists to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients. This article is protected by copyright.
