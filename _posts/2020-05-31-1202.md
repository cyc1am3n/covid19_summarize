- "Background The United States now has the highest death toll due to COVID-19. Many otolaryngology procedures, including laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy, place otolaryngologists at increased risk of coronavirus transmission due to close contact with respiratory droplets and aerosolization from the procedure. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of guidelines on how to perform these procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods Literature review was performed. Articles citing laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy use in regards to COVID-19 were included. Results Laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy are all used in both emergent and elective situations. Understanding the risk stratification of cases and the varied necessity of personal protective equipment is important in protecting patients and healthcare workers. Conclusions Summary guidelines based on the literature available at this time is presented in order to decrease transmission of the virus and protect those involved.
