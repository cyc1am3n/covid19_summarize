summary:
- "WhatsApp's advantages include being highly intuitive, widely used and accessible. There are concerns among clinicians about its use, as well as that of other commercially available communications apps. These include the loss of anonymity to patients, the need to reveal their personal telephone number and questions over privacy and data security. Deepak and colleagues highlighted the virtues of instant messaging tools during the COVID-19 crisis(1). We laud the benefits of WhatsApp during the crisis. It was widely used, widely available and highly intuitive. Some clinicians have been praised by Deepak, widely-used and accessible, but there are concerns over its use."

Whilst WhatsApp's advantages include being highly intuitive, widely used and accessible, there are concerns among clinicians about its use, as well as that of other commercially available communications apps. These include the loss of anonymity to patients, the need to reveal their personal telephone number as well questions over privacy and data security."
