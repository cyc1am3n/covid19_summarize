summary:
- "SARS-Cov-2 has spread all over the world, being recognized as the causing agent of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy to efficiently control the clinical course of the disease and the spread of the outbreak. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COV-19 have peculiar safety profiles."

original:
- "Starting from December 2019 the novel SARS-Cov-2 has spread all over the world, being recognized as the causing agent of COVID-19. Since nowadays no specific drug therapies neither vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19, drug repositioning may offer a strategy to efficiently control the clinical course of the disease and the spread of the outbreak. In this paper we aim to describe the main pharmacological properties, including data on mechanism of action, safety concerns and drug-drug interactions, of drugs currently administered in patients with COVID-19, focusing on antivirals and drugs with immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 were reported. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency of COVID-19. For many of these drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit in improving patients' clinical conditions. However, adequate clinical trials are necessary to reach any firm conclusion on the efficacy and safety profiles of these compounds. Even though drug repurposing is necessary, it requires caution. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COVID-19 have peculiar safety profiles. In conclusion, while waiting for the development of effective preventive measures, such as vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. It is conceivable that very soon their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications."
