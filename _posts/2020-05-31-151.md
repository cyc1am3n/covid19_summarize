summary:
- "CoVID-19 is a novel and exponentially growing disease. All humans on earth need to make difficult strategic decisions on three very different scales, all fueled by Analytical and Artificial Intelligence-based predictive Models (AAIMs). accelerated development of knowledge from good data is possible quickly and globally. In order to combat the global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), all humans on Earth must make strategic decisions. The accelerating development of good data from data is an exponentially-growing disease and rapidly growing disease and rapid growth. all humans have to make crucial decisions on."
