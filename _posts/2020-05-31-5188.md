summary:
- "the outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the burgeoning pneumonia (COVID-19) incidence in Wuhan, China, has led me to ask myself many questions. As an infectious disease physician, I have personally examined many patients and been actively involved in the prevention and treatment process. If we could relive this experience, what would we do differently? Could we reduce the case fatality rate in the Wuhan area to roughly resemble that of other areas or the Spanish flu? As a human tragedy in China has led to the novel 2018 coron. CoV-2 and the novel."

original:
- "Since the outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the burgeoning pneumonia (COVID-19) incidence in Wuhan, China, I have personally examined many patients and been actively involved in the prevention and treatment process. As an infectious disease physician and witness to this human tragedy, this has led me to ask myself many questions. The most important might be: if we could relive this experience, what would we do differently? Could we reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) in the Wuhan area to roughly resemble that of other areas or the Spanish flu?"
