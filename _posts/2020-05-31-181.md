original:
- "In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, and it subsequently spread in many countries around the world. Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time. Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed. We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic."
