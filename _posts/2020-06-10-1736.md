summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and causing COVID-19. Multiple cases showed SARS - CoV-2 positive again in discharged patients. There is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of the infection. We conducted postmortem pathologic study in a ready-for-discharge patient. Pathological examination revealed virus-caused pathological changes in the lungs."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus and causing COVID-19, has given rise to a worldwide pandemic.1,2 So far, tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients have been clinically cured and discharged, but multiple COVID-19 cases showed SARS-CoV-2 positive again  in discharged patients,3 which raises an attention for the discharged patients. Also, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we conducted postmortem pathologic study in a ready-for-discharge COVID-19 patient who succumbed to sudden cardiovascular accident. Pathological examination revealed SARS-CoV-2-viruses remaining in pneumocytes and virus-caused pathological changes in the lungs. Our study provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and might facilitate the improvement of clinical guideline for virus containment and disease management."
