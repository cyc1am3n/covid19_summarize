summary:
- "Crystallography in its broadest sense has a crucial role to play in addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic. An outpouring of structural information on key viral proteins has resulted. These data have immediately been shared with researchers around the world to speed the discovery of effective therapeutic agents. The data have now been shared to speed up the discovery."
