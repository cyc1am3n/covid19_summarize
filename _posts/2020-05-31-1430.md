summary:
- "the pandemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories in the past 4 months. To save lives and minimize transmission, millions of healthcare workers are working in front lines worldwide but putting themselves at high risk from the disease. Many barriers limit the implementation of conventional evidence-based interventions in this emergent setting. The World Health Organization (WHO) and many institutions have proposed guidelines to provide psychological assistance for healthcare workers."

original:
- "The pandemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories in the past 4 months. To save lives and minimize transmission, millions of healthcare workers are working in front lines worldwide but putting themselves at high risk from the disease. All of them are working under extreme pressures and experiencing great psychological distress in such a challenging situation. In addition to the huge psychological pressure, healthcare workers around the world face morale and burnout issues as they have to make impossible decisions (Greenberg, Docherty, Gnanapragasam, & Wessely, 2020). It is encouraging is that the World Health Organization (WHO) and many institutions have proposed guidelines to provide psychological assistance for healthcare workers during this pandemic. However, it is important to ensure that evidence-based intervention strategies are employed so that already over-stretched resources can be maximized. Many barriers limit the implementation of conventional evidence-based interventions in this emergent setting."
