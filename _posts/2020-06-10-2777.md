summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the health care system with challenges that have limited science to guide the staff, stuff and structure surge response. Multiple professional societies, nongovernment and government agencies have studied the science of sudden onset disaster mass casualty incidents to create and promote surge response guidelines. The available surge science literature was reviewed to determine the application to an emergency department's surge structural response response - a checklist was created to guide an Emergency Department team's response structure. Several professional societies and nongovernment agencies have reviewed the scientific literature to develop and promote the COVD-19 Pandemic. the health system. There are challenges."

original:
- "Multiple professional societies, nongovernment and government agencies have studied the science of sudden onset disaster mass casualty incidents to create and promote surge response guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented the health care system with challenges that have limited science to guide the staff, stuff and structure surge response.This study reviewed the available surge science literature specifically to guide an Emergency Department's surge structural response using a translational science approach to answer the question: How does the concept of sudden onset mass casualty incident (MCI) surge capability apply to the process to expand COVID-19 Pandemic surge structure response?The available surge structural science literature was reviewed to determine the application to a pandemic response. The on-line ahead of print and print COVID-19 scientific publications, as well as grey, literature were studied to learn the best available COVID-19 surge structural response science. A checklist was created to guide the Emergency Department team's COVID-19 surge structural response."
