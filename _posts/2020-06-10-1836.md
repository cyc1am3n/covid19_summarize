original:
- "A pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has spread rapidly to multiple countries. In the United States, the first confirmed case was reported on January 20, 2020, and since then, the number of cases is rising exponentially on a daily basis. We report a case of COVID-19 infection that presented with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. Due to the major backlog with an immense number of pending tests, it took 48 hours for the result to come back positive, while the patient went into acute respiratory distress syndrome. We provide an internist's perspective of the difficulties encountered in terms of the available management options, as the patient progressively deteriorated on the regular medical floor prompting transfer to the intensive care unit."
