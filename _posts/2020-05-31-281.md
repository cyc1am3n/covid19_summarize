summary:
- "67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department enrolled 67 patients. Patients showed significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480&ndash;747) vs. 455. a higher percentage of patients with SARS had a lower concentration. Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVId-19 patients compared to those without SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups according to the presence or absence of SARS in the population. A novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus patients were enrolled in the emergency department."

original:
- "Introduction: A novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus able to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been recently recognized as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which has spread rapidly from China to other countries. Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. Material and Methods: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. Results: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480&ndash;747) vs. 455 (352.5&ndash;588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels &gt;400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0&ndash;834.0) vs. 567 (472.5&ndash;644.50); p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment."
