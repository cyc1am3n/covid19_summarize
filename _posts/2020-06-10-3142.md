summary:
- "the novel SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout China, Europe and USA. The pneumonia may evolve in ARDS requiring assisted mechanical-ventilation. A cluster of pneumonia cases caused by the novel novel has spread quickly. It could be complication including pulmonary embolism. Maintaining the same pro-active attitude suggested by current Guidelines might help in reducing morality and improving survival in SARS COV-2/patients. We report the first case of SARS. CoV-2 complicated by massive pulmonary. COV-2 is a novel. a cluster of cases has spread across China and Europe."

original:
- "A cluster of pneumonia cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout China, Europe and USA. The pneumonia might evolve in ARDS requiring assisted mechanical-ventilation. The prolonged immobilization combined with respiratory failure, sepsis and dehydration might expose SARS-CoV-2/patients to increased risk of complication including pulmonary embolism. We report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 complicated by massive pulmonary embolism underwent successfully surgical embolectomy. We believe that maintaining the same pro-active attitude suggested by current Guidelines might help in reducing morality and improving survival in SARS-COV-2/patients."
