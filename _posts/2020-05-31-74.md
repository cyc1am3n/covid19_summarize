summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has already exerted an enormous impact on the entire world. The countries that have already reported the peak of transmission are easing their preventive measures. If the virus causes that next wave, are we sufficiently prepared to deal with it? The stakeholders concerned must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence. To relax the prevention measures, countries must thoroughly review their situations while making effective preparations for its second wave of infection."

original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has already exerted an enormous impact on the entire world. Everything is overwhelmed in the face of a rapid escalation of cases. The countries that have already reported the peak of transmission are easing their preventive measures yet fearing a second wave of infection. If the virus causes that next wave, are we sufficiently prepared to deal with it? I argue that the stakeholders concerned should simultaneously handle the ongoing pandemic while making effective preparations for its second wave. To relax the preventive measures, countries must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence."
