summary:
- "we ran a simulation comparing 3 methods to calculate case-fatality risk for coronavirus disease. The current trajectory of the epidemic should be considered when comparing real-time risk. Case fatality risk calculated from these methods all are biased at the early stage of the outbreak. If comparing the risk, the current trajectory will be considered. Using the same methods, the risk should be compared. We used the same parameters described in previous studies. In the simulation, we looked at 3 different methods. Results were used to compare 3 methods comparing cases to comparing case. Methods comparing."
