summary:
- "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization. CNS manifestations range from vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether neurological dysfunction is due to direct viral injury or systemic disease. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of ongoing scientific and clinical findings."

original:
- "The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting 2.7 million individuals globally as of April 25, 2020 with over 187,000 deaths. A growing body of evidence supports central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Methods We conducted a review of the literature for articles concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines. Results CNS manifestations range from vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether neurological dysfunction is due to direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus may affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of ongoing scientific and clinical findings. Conclusions This review consolidates the current body of literature regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discusses the reported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, and highlights recommendations for patient management. Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons are provided."
