summary:
- "COVID-19 has become a pandemic since March 2020. Both patients died despite the maximum mechanical ventilatory support. Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome. The prognosis of the disease is not optimistic and remains guarded. Low T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection. Two cases have been diagnosed in a post-transplant setting. Coronavirus Disease 2019 has become an epidemic since March 20."

original:
- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since March 2020. We describe here, two cases of COVID-19 infection in a post-transplant setting. First one is a 59-year old renal transplant recipient; the second is a 51-year old allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient. Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued and methylprednisolone with prophylactic antibiotics were initiated, however, the lung injury progressed. The T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection. Both patients died despite the maximal mechanical ventilatory support. Therefore, the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia following transplantation is not optimistic and remains guarded. Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome."
