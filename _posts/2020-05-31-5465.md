summary:
- "Chinese physicians and researchers held multidisciplinary teleconference on February 5, 2020. Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections in pregnancy. There is no clear evidence regarding optimal delivery timing, safety of vaginal delivery, or if cesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery. Route of delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal-fetal status. Currently, there is no evidence."
