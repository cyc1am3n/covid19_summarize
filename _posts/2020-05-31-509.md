summary:
- "IL-2R/lymphocyte was a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe COVID-19 and predicting the clinical progression of the disease. Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with the disease severity. Leukocytes, neutrophils, infection biomarkers and concentrations of CRP, PCT and ferritin were significantly increased while lymphocytes were significantly decreased with increased severity of illness."

original:
- "Effective laboratory markers for estimation of disease severity and predicting the clinical progression of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is urgent needed. METHODS: The laboratory tests including blood routine, cytokine profiles and infection markers were collected from 389 confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The included patients were classified into mild (n=168), severe (n=169) and critical groups (n=52). The leukocytes, neutrophils, infection biomarkers (such as CRP, PCT and ferritin) and the concentrations of cytokines (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) were significantly increased while lymphocytes were significantly decreased with increased severity of illness. The amounts of IL-2R was positively correlated with the other cytokines and negatively correlated with lymphocyte number. The ratio of IL-2R to lymphocytes was found remarkably increased in severe and critical patients. IL-2R/lymphocyte was superior compared with other markers for the identification of COVID-19 with critical illness not only from mild but also from severe illness. Moreover, the cytokine profiles and IL-2R/lymphocyte were significantly decreased in recovered patients but further increased in disease deteriorated patients, which might be correlated with the outcome of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with the disease severity. IL-2R/lymphocyte was a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe COVID-19 and predicting the clinical progression of the disease."
