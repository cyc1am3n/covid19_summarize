summary:
- "Surgical tracheostomies have a role in the weaning process of COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care units. The cohort was 100% male with 90% of them having a raised Body Mass Index (BMI) 50% have been decannulated and have been stepped down the intensive care unit. A multidisciplinary team approach (MDT) is required for decision making. This process is augmented by specific standard operating practices implemented by senior clinicians."

original:
- "Surgical tracheostomies have a role in the weaning process of COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care units. A multidisciplinary team approach (MDT) is required for decision making. This process is augmented by specific standard operating practices implemented by senior clinicians. Here, we report on our early experience and outcomes with open tracheostomies in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. We outline the criteria that guide decision making and explore the challenges faced by our intensive care colleagues in the management of these patients. The cohort was 100% male with 90% of them having a raised Body Mass Index (BMI) and other comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). 50% have been decannulated and have been stepped down the intensive care unit. We recorded no surgical complications or adverse events. The service to date has been shown to be effective, safe, largely reproducible and reflective."
