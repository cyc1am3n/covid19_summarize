original:
- "A 67-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with a 5-day history of fevers and chills, nonproductive cough, myalgias, and malaise. He has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Of note, he was at a dental conference 2 weeks prior where an attendee had tested positive for COVID-19. At triage, his temperature is 38.7 C, heart rate 120, blood pressure 80/40, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 93% on room air. The triage nurse fits the patient with a mask, places him in an individual room, and puts him on contact and droplet precautions."
