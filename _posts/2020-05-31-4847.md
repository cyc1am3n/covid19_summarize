summary:
- "the first case of coronavirus disease was confirmed in Finland on 29 January 2020. No secondary cases were detected. The SARS-CoV-2/Finland/1/2020 virus strain was isolated. Neutralising antibody response appeared within 9 days along with specific IgM and IgG response. We describe the clinical picture and laboratory findings 3-23 days since the first symptoms. A single nucleotide substitution to the reference strain from Wuhan was found."

- "The first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Finland was confirmed on 29 January 2020. No secondary cases were detected. We describe the clinical picture and laboratory findings 3-23 days since the first symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2/Finland/1/2020 virus strain was isolated, the genome showing a single nucleotide substitution to the reference strain from Wuhan. Neutralising antibody response appeared within 9 days along with specific IgM and IgG response, targeting particularly nucleocapsid and spike proteins."
