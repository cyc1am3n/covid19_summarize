summary:
- "a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus elucidated as the aetiologic agent. The disease has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries. This is the third novel outbreak in the last two decades. It presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources."

original:
- "In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus elucidated as the aetiologic agent. Although most initial cases occurred in China, the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries. This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of COVID-19 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in COVID-19 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality. In this article we discuss some of the peri-operative and critical care resource planning considerations and management strategies employed in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore in response to the COVID-19 outbreak."
