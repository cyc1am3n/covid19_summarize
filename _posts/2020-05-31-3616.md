summary:
- "emergency efforts are underway to find optimum medical products to prevent infection. Production and supply chains for COVID-19 candidate drugs are being disrupted. Supply chains for other diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) are being repurposed to use. Without adequate supporting evidence, they are being used. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is affecting the production and supply chain."

original:
- "Emergency efforts are underway to find optimum medical products to prevent infection and diagnose and treat patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Production and supply chains for COVID-19 candidate drugs (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and for many other essential medical products, are being impaired by this crisis.1 Supply chains for vital drugs for other diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) are being disrupted because they are being repurposed to use against COVID-19, without adequate supporting evidence."
