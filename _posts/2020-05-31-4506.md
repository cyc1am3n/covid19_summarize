original:
- "As the spread of COVID-19 illnesses continues to escalate amidst a substandard supply of protective equipment for health care providers, the question of extended use or reuse of N95 masks has emerged. As well, the relative effectiveness of the N95 compared to other mask types have been entertained. A recent article by Abd-Elsayed and Karri aim to put these topics into focus. Additionally, personal correspondence between Drs. Richard Prielipp (University of Minnesota Department of Anesthesiology) and Peter Tsai (inventor of the N95 mask) offers perspectives on managing the reuse of this central element of protective equipment. The author declares no conflicts of interest. ?? 2020 International Anesthesia Research Society"
