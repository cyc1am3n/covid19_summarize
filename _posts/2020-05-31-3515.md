summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in the type II surfactant-secreting alveolar cells of the lungs. The disease is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and immune mediators."

original:
- "With more than 81 000 deaths worldwide from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by April 8, 2020,1 it is incumbent on researchers to accelerate clinical trials of any readily available and potentially acceptably safe therapies that could reduce the rising death toll. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in the type II surfactant-secreting alveolar cells of the lungs.2 Severe COVID-19 is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and immune mediators."
