summary:
- "as of April 6, 2020, there are over 1,200,000 reported cases and 70,000 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most effective means of minimizing the spread of the virus is through reducing interactions between individuals. We performed a review of the literature, as well as national and international treatment guidelines. This work is to guide radiation oncologists managing patients with gastrointestinal cancers during the COVId-19 crisis to maintain the safety of our patients. CDC: There are more than 70,000 cases and 16,000 reported cases, according to the disease. As of April 6."

original:
- "As of April 6, 2020, there are over 1,200,000 reported cases and 70,000 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and these numbers rise exponentially by the day.[1] According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the most effective means of minimizing the spread of the virus is through reducing interactions between individuals.[2] We performed a review of the literature, as well as national and international treatment guidelines, seeking data in support of the RADS principle (Remote visits, Avoid radiation, Defer radiation, Shorten radiation)[3] as it applies to gastrointestinal cancers. The purpose of the present work is to guide radiation oncologists managing patients with gastrointestinal cancers during the COVID-19 crisis in order to maintain the safety of our patients, while minimizing the impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes."
