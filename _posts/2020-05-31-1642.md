summary:
- "Upon admission to the hospital, his clinical condition deteriorates requiring ventilatory support. We explore the value of imaging and other potential predictors of deterioration. This case report describes a young patient with COVID-19 who is initially diagnosed with CT chest imaging. The case report is based on a case report describing a patient who is diagnosed with a deteriorating condition. Upon hospital admission, his condition is requiring ventilation."
