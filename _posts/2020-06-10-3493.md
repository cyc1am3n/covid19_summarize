summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 has spread world-wide since December 2019. Failure to anticipate the spread of the virus now seriously threatens many health systems. We have designed a model for predicting the evolution of the epidemic in France. It is based on seroprevalence and makes it possible to anticipate deconfinement strategy. The virus is likely affecting millions of people and killing thousands. If it is not predicted, it could be a threat to many health system."
