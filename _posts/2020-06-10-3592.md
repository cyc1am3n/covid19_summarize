summary:
- "the number of infected individuals and cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has increased exponentially worldwide. There is evidence that orchitis can develop due to the infection. It is therefore not unreasonable to believe that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by semen. Consequently, it is of paramount importance that individuals who could potentially be infect take all possible care to mitigate the likely risk of passing on the infection through sexual intercourse. The number of cases of the infection has been increasing exponentially increasing since the start of the latest coronan virus has increased worldwide has increased since the outbreak has been rising exponentially."

Of interest is existing evidence that orchitis can develop due coronavirus infection. It is therefore not unreasonable to believe that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by semen. Consequently, it is of paramount importance that individuals who could potentially be infected take all possible care to mitigate the likely risk of passing on the infection through sexual intercourse."
