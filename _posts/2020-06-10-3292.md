summary:
- "COVID-19 epidemic makes the management of acute myocardial infarction more complicated, effective treatment without further dissemination is thus quite challenging. Recently, we successfully treated three representative AMI cases. We summarized some important issues including patient screening, reperfusion strategy selecting, personnel/catheter lab protection principle, as well as operation tactics. This may lend precious experience on AMI treating during the ongoing COVD-19 pandemic situation. In this article, we summarized several important issues."
