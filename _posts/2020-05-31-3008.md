original:
- "Canada's cattle/beef sector has already weathered a shock after a 2003 case of BSE resulted in closed borders and industry restructuring. Now the sector has to adjust to similar shocks due to COVID-19. This paper examines the supply chain from the consumer up to the cow-calf producer by considering consumer reactions, labour market constraints, and supply response. A quarterly market model of North American cattle and beef markets is used to examine price and revenue impacts associated with the market disruptions. Depending on the scenario, there is considerable price and revenue suppression at all levels of the market. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved"
