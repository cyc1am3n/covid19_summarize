summary:
- "Considering that intermediate hosts are generally mammals [5], they are likely the living mammals sold in the South China seafood market. Strengthening the monitoring of wild mammals is an urgent measure to prevent similar viruses from infecting humans in future. More than 1,000 confirmed cases have been reported in China. The number of provinces and cities in China as well as other countries with confirmed cases are steadily increasing. It is necessary to further strengthen the monitoring to ensure that it will not cause diseases like Global Outbreak of 2003 SARS."
