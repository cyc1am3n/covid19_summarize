summary:
- "138 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, were treated in an intensive care unit. 25% had cardiovascular disease and 58% hypertension. Predisposition to acute cardiac complications related to underlying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may significantly increase the severity. Approximately one-third have comorbidities, according to early data. Of 138 patients treated in a Wuhan hospital, 25% have cardiovascular disease. The figures for non-ICU-treated COVId-19 patients were hospitalized and treated in the intensive care units in China."

original:
- "Early data from Wuhan, China show that patients with COVID-19 are typically male, aged 40 to 60 years, and about one-third have comorbidities. Moreover, of 138 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan and treated in an intensive care unit (ICU), 25% had cardiovascular disease and 58% hypertension; the respective figures for non-ICU-treated COVID-19 patients were 10% and 22% [1]. Based on these early data, a predisposition to acute cardiac complications related to underlying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may significantly increase the severity of COVID-19 in susceptible individuals."
