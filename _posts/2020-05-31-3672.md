title: "TMPRSS2 and COVID-19: Serendipity or opportunity for intervention?"

summary:
- "TMPRSS2 is the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer. It is a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of its expression by sex steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections. This is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infection. There are no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available."

original:
- "TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of its expression by sex steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections."
