summary:
- "the epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and malaria in the initial phase of the ongoing pandemic. The endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from the outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries. Some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggest their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronanavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects. All these data provide important insights to understand the epidemiologic paradox between malaria and the outbreak of covid-19 and malaria, we found in the current work."

original:
- "In the current work, we discovered and analyzed the epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and malaria in the initial phase of the ongoing pandemic. From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries. In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection. Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity). All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications."
