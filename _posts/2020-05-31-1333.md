summary:
- "Thrombotic coagulopathy is present in nearly three-quarters of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Numerous studies are ongoing focusing on anti-cytokine therapies, antibiotics and anti-viral agents. None to-date have focused on treating the underlying thrombotic coagulopathic in an effort to improve respiratory failure. Animal data and a previous human trial demonstrated a survival advantage with fibrinolytic therapy to treat ARDS."

original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused respiratory failure and associated mortality in numbers that have overwhelmed global health systems. Thrombotic coagulopathy is present in nearly three-quarters of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and both the clinical picture and pathologic findings are consistent with microvascular occlusive phenomena being a major contributor to their unique form of respiratory failure. Numerous studies are ongoing focusing on anti-cytokine therapies, antibiotics and anti-viral agents, but none to-date have focused on treating the underlying thrombotic coagulopathy in an effort to improve respiratory failure in COVID-19. There is animal data and a previous human trial demonstrating a survival advantage with fibrinolytic therapy to treat ARDS. Here we review the extant and emerging literature on the relationship between thrombotic coagulopathy and pulmonary failure in the context of COVID-19 and present the scientific rationale for consideration of targeting the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to improve pulmonary function in these patients."
