summary:
- "the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing the management of many chronic diseases. The performance of routine endoscopy is temporarily suspended. Only emergency endoscoring is allowed in many countries where IBD has spread. We propose a pathway for performing safe endosescopy and discuss the potential risks of postponing endostascopy in IBD. A post-pandemic plan is proposed for access to endoskopie."

original:
- "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing the management of many chronic diseases, including that of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In particular, the performance of routine endoscopy is temporarily suspended, and only emergency endoscopy is allowed in many countries where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread. We highlight different scenarios in which endoscopy should still be performed urgently in patients with IBD, as well as recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment. We suggest a pathway for performing safe endoscopy and discuss the potential risks of postponing endoscopy in IBD. Finally, we propose a post-pandemic plan for access to endoscopy."
