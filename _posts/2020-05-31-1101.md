summary:
- "Italy, with 21,157 positive cases and 1441 deaths, and South Korea were the most important countries affected as of March 15th. In Iran, the first case was identified on 19 Feb 2020 in Qom. To date, March 16, 2020, 14991 COVID-19 cases with 853 deaths have been reported from all 29 provinces of Iran. Iran has achieved more success in controlling and preventing patient deaths rather than some developed countries, like Italy."

original:
- "Although, the COVID-19 incidence has declined sharply since February 13th , 2020 in China, the prevalence increased faster in other countries than scientists anticipated. Italy, with 21,157 positive cases and 1441 deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 6.81 %), and South Korea with 8162 positive cases and 75 death (CFR=0.91 %), were the most important countries affected as of March 15th [2]. In Iran, the first case was identified on 19 Feb 2020 in Qom. To date, March 16, 2020, 14991 COVID-19 cases with 853 deaths (CFR=5.69%) have been reported from all 29 provinces of Iran; among these states, Tehran has shown the highest incidence with 3774 positive cases [2]. Although Iran has achieved more success in controlling and preventing patient deaths rather than some developed countries, like Italy (CFR=6.81 %), there are some defects in controlling of this global crisis in Iran. Thus, achieving success and overcoming this uninvited guest in Iran requires that we understand these deficiencies."
