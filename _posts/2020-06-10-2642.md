original:
- "As of March 30(th), 2020 there were 161,807 total cases and 2,953 total deaths of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with the number of cases expected to rise. Other than supportive care, there are no SARS-CoV-2 specific treatments available for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) or those admitted to the hospital. In addition, there are no vaccines available to protect our at-risk healthcare workers. The National Institutes of Health is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate for a potential vaccine and the recipients have started to receive the investigational vaccine.(2) We present a brief overview of the potential prophylactic and treatment agents under investigation, some which could be initiated in the ED if proven effective."
