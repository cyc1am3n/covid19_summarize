summary:
- "emergence of viral respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential. Respiratory viral infections are associated with cytokine production, inflammation, cell death, and other pathophysiological processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease have been associated with the age. The aim of the present work was to contribute with the understanding of the possible link between oxidative stress and the pathogenesis, severity and mortality risk in patients affected by the disease."

original:
- "The emergence of viral respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the pathogenic agent of Covid-19, represent a serious health problem worldwide. Respiratory viral infections are, in general, associated with cytokine production, inflammation, cell death, and other pathophysiological processes, which could be link with a redox imbalance or oxidative stress. These phenomena are substantially increased during aging. Actually, severity and mortality risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease have been associated with the age. The aim of the present work was to contribute with the understanding of the possible link between oxidative stress and the pathogenesis, severity and mortality risk in patients affected by SARS-CoV infection."
