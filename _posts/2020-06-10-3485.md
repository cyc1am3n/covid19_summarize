summary:
- "the tissue receptor for COVID-19 is ACE2, and higher levels of ACE2 can protect against ARDS. Angiotensin receptor blockers and statins upregulate ACE2. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether this drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe COVD-19 infection. Patients at risk of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and death. Clinical trials need to determine if the drug combination may be used."
