summary:
- "Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory case due to Coronavirus on February 18, 2020. The number of infected people is growing exponentially with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route. This article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dressing code modalities. Since that time, Italy and nations across the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from Coronavirus in February 2020, soon after the initial reports in China."

- "Italy recorded its first case of confirmed acute respiratory case due to Coronavirus on February 18, 2020, soon after the initial reports in China. Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dressing code modalities, which have been implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection."
