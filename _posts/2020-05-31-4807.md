original:
- "Before the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, coronaviruses (CoVs) were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans. However, it was this epidemic that highlighted this group of viruses and included them among the causative agents of emerging epidemic diseases. In addition, in 2012, another new CoV responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome was identified. Both infections were considered a threat to global health security. At present, the third epidemic caused by a CoV is being faced. This new CoV, called 2019-nCoV, was originated in the city of Wuhan, China, and has been linked to severe respiratory infections in humans. Thanks to the collaboration of experts worldwide, more information about this virus and its infection is reported each day, which allows modifying the recommendations for its prevention and treatment, without forgetting that the ultimate goal is to control this epidemic. In this review, the important aspects of this new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and its disease, COVID-19, have been summarized with the information available up to February 2020."
