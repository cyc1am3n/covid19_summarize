summary:
- "Historically, the term ?resilience? encompasses both physiological and psychological aspects. The latter is personal to individuals. Some people have more developed strategies for personal resilience than others. resilience is viewed in some cases as an inherent personality trait and in others as a dynamic process existing on a continuum between resilience and vulnerability. Understandings of resilience vary between populations, contexts and cultures."

original:
- "Personal resilience has been conceptualised in many different ways; however, a common definition is that resilience is the ability to cope successfully despite adverse circumstances (Henshall, 2020). Historically, the term ?resilience? encompasses both physiological and psychological aspects and the latter is personal to individuals, with some people having more developed strategies for personal resilience than others. Understandings of resilience vary between populations, contexts and cultures (McDonald et al., 2012), with resilience being viewed in some cases as an inherent personality trait and in others as a dynamic process existing on a continuum between resilience and vulnerability."
