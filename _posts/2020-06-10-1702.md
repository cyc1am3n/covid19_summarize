summary:
- "the COVID-19 virus uses the enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) to gain entry into cells. 3 receptors have been revealed in the neuronal and glial cells of the human brain. This could be responsible for the death of olfactory cells in patients with the virus. The presence of ACE2 receptors in the cerebral nervous system was confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of patients during an autopsy."

original:
- "The COVID-19 virus uses the enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) to gain entry into cells. 3 These receptors have been revealed in the neuronal and glial cells of the human brain, thus being a potential target of COVID-19. This could be responsible for the death of olfactory cells in patients with COVID-19. 1 CoVs can enter the central nervous system through two distinct pathways: retrograde neuronal diffusion or hematogenous diffusion. The spread of COVID- 19 through the cribriform plaque of the ethmoid bone during an initial or subsequent infection phase can lead to brain involvement. As for systemic circulation, the presence of ACE2 receptors on both capillary and neuronal endothelial cells could be responsible for the subsequent spread and damage to the cerebral nervous system without substantial inflammation. The presence of CoVs in the cerebral nervous system was confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of patients during an autopsy. 4"
