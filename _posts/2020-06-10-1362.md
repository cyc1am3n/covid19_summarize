- "Currently, no licensed preventative vaccine or specific anti-viral therapy is available for COVID-19, and according to the basic theory of controlling infectious diseases, the most effective measures include eliminating the source of infection, disrupting transmission and protecting susceptible individuals. Therefore, in order to cope with a sudden outbreak of COVID-19, the community needs to be screened, and it also needs to be understood in time for the dynamics of whether the infection has occurred. Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) has begun designing and implementing an electronic national screening system https://salamat.gov.ir/ using modern information network technology.10 After logging information such as national code, date of birth, phone number into the system, people will answer some questions about COVID-19 symptoms, immunosuppression and some chronic diseases, as well as the presence of people suspected of having COVID-19 disease in their relatives. People who are suspected of having the disease will receive an SMS from their health status, then health care providers will call 4030 and guide them. Also, the location of their lives will be disinfected and other family members will be quarantined if required. If they do not improve within three days, they will be referred to Emergency Department of Hospitals. Some screening-related information has been listed."
