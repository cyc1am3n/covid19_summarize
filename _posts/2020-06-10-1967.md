summary:
- "Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are urgently needed. Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. The research examines evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid19. This review is to examine the body of evidence that could support the hypothesis that immune enhancement could be relevant to the virus."

original:
- "The pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus - SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a cause of acute respiratory illness, named Covid-19, is placing the healthcare systems of many countries under unprecedented stress. Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle - the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis."
