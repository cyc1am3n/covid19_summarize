original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of academic medical center missions. The number and rapidity of innovative responses to the crisis are extraordinary. When the pandemic has subsided, the world of academic medicine will have changed. The author of this Invited Commentary anticipates that at least some of these innovations will become part of academic medicine's everyday clinical and educational operations. Here he considers the implications of exemplary innovations-virtual care, hospital at home, advances in diagnosis and therapy, virtual learning, and virtual clinical learning-for regulators, academic medical centers, faculty, and students."
