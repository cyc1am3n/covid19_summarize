summary:
- "studies demonstrate that upregulation of ACE2 has a protective effect on SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. Animal studies show that dietary intake can modulate ACE 2 gene expression and function. We postulate on the biological plausibility of interactions between dietary fat and/or resveratrol and ACE2-gen variations in the modulation of SARS. The cellular receptor is responsible for the pathogenesis of the virus, thus impacting the entrance and clearance of the disease. A high intake of reassoil can have a positive effect on the pathogenic effect."

original:
- "The ACE2 cellular receptor is responsible for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, thus impacting the entrance and clearance of the virus. Studies demonstrate that upregulation of ACE2 has a protective effect on SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. Moreover, animal studies demonstrate that dietary intake can modulate ACE2 gene expression and function. A high intake of resveratrol may have a protective role, upregulating ACE2, whereas a high intake of dietary fat may have a detrimental role, downregulating ACE2. As such, we postulate on the biological plausibility of interactions between dietary fat and/or resveratrol and ACE2 gene variations in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. We call to action the research community to test this plausible interaction in a sample of human subjects."
