summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is probably a novel recombinant virus. Its genome is closest to that of horseshoe bats, and its receptor-binding domain is close to pangolin viruses. The virus's origin and direct ancestral viruses have not been identified. We showed that the virus is probably the novel virus - and its genome is a bit closer to the genome of horses bats. There have been no trace of its origins and ancestral viruses in the past. Acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 is likely to be a new. its receptor binding. it's genome."

Its genome is closest to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses from horseshoe bats, and its receptor-binding domain is closest to that of pangolin viruses.
