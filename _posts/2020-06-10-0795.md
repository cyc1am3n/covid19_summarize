summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that led to the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in substantial overburdening of healthcare systems and an economic crisis on a global scale. Therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also being applied for novel small molecule discovery. Estimated timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine have been estimated to be 12-18 months or longer."

original:
- "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that led to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic has resulted in substantial overburdening of healthcare systems as well as an economic crisis on a global scale. This has in turn resulted in widespread efforts to identify suitable therapies to address this aggressive pathogen. Therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored, and a Phase I clinical trial of mRNA-1273 which was developed in collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna, Inc. is currently underway. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also being applied for novel small molecule discovery. Estimated timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine have been estimated to be 12-18 months or longer. Accelerated small molecule and antibody discovery may also lead to deployment of approved treatments on the several months to year-long timeframe. All of these are promising approaches that may lead to sustained efficacy in treating COVID-19. However, its emergence has also necessitated a rapid response that has led to a large number of clinical trials evaluating drug combinations comprised of repurposed therapies. While initial study readouts have resulted in limited successes and downstream successes may be on the horizon, harnessing AI to optimize drug repurposing and combination therapy design may lead to the rapid identification of regimens that mediate unexpected and markedly enhanced treatment outcomes.
