summary:
- "the epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection. Recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well. We report two representative false-positive cases and discuss the role of clinical data with rRT."

original:
- "The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including laboratory examination results and computed tomography features. Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well."
