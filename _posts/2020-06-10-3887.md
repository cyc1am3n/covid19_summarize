summary:
- "the existing contract between science and society is falling apart. A new covenant is urgently needed to navigate the days ahead. Science has never seemed more needed and useful, while at the same time limited and powerless. The existing contract has fallen apart, and science has always seemed more needless and useful. New covenant needs to navigate days ahead to navigate pandemics. It is a new covenant that is needed for the future to navigate."
