summary:
- "COVID-19 epidemic has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life among patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies. 158 patients switched to remote assistance at the time of the outbreak. Quality of life worse in the group of patients who become at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. The anxiety to run out of medications is a major new issue."

original:
- "A rapidly expanding epidemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life among patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies. AIM OF THE STUDY: to identify factors impacting the Health-Related-Quality of Life among Italian patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies switched to remote assistance at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Survey on quality of life in 158 Primary Antibody Deficiency patients measured by the CVID_QoL, a disease-specific tool, and by the GHQ-12, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, we shifted all PAD patients to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email four weeks later. CVID_QoL and GHQ-12 data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life worse in the group of patients who become at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. Health-Related-Quality of Life was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated to SARS-CoV-2 pandemia and to patients' fragility, and not to related clinical conditions associated with Common Variable Immune Deficiencies. The anxiety to run out of medications is a major new issue. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 epidemic impacted HRQoL and the risk of anxiety/depression of PAD patients. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQoL."
