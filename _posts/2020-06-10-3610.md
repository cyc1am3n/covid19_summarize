summary:
- "Identifying a solution for the new coronavirus pandemic is on the agenda of scientists of the world. Herein, we summarize all the suggested global solutions proposed so far to stop this dangerous virus. Also, the important molecular targets for hitting the killer virus are highlighted. We summarize the possible solutions proposed by scientists and physicians so far so far. This is an immediate priority for finding a new solution."
