summary:
- "five of six family members were SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobin serology testing positive, while molecular assays only detected two of these five patients even repeated twice. Results emphasized the significance of serology tests to assist timely diagnosis. Two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, two were suspected of COVD-19 and two were considered close contacts. We identified a familial cluster of cases based on clinical characteristics, chest CT images, and serology test results."

original:
- "Confirmative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been challenged due to unsatisfactory positive rate of molecular assays. Here we identified a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with five of six family members were SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobin serology testing positive, while molecular assays only detected two of this five patients even repeated twice. We comprehensively analyzed this familial cluster of cases based on the clinical characteristics, chest CT images, SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection results, and serology testing results. At last, two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, two were suspected of COVID-19, and two were considered close contacts. Our results emphasized the significance of serology testing to assist timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially for COVID-19 close contacts screening."
