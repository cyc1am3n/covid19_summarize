summary:
- "paper highlights the enormous economic and social impact of COVID-19. It is outlined by drawing on literatures that have either prognosticated such a large-scale event or assessed the impacts of other past events. A consideration of the characteristics of the event, along with what research suggests, points toward avenues of future investigation. Several literatures have also been drawn on the impact of other events that roughly parallel the event. The paper also highlights the impact on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly."

original:
- "This paper highlights the enormous economic and social impact of COVID-19 with respect to articles that have either prognosticated such a large-scale event, and its economic consequences, or have assessed the impacts of other epidemics and pandemics. A consideration of possible impacts of COVID-19 on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly, is briefly outlined by drawing on a variety of literatures. A consideration of the characteristics of COVID-19, along with what research suggests have been the impacts of other past events that in some ways roughly parallel COVID-19, points toward avenues of future investigation."
