summary:
- "Spatial lifecourse epidemiology aims to use advanced spatial, location-aware, and artificial intelligence technologies to investigate long-term effects of measurable biological, environmental, behavioral, and psychosocial factors on individual risk for chronic diseases. It could also further the research on infectious disease dynamics, risks, and consequences across the life course. The research could further the study on infectious diseases dynamics and risks. aims could further research on the lifecourse."
