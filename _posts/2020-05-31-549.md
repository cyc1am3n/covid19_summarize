summary:
- "current pandemic and its pleotropic effects can be explained in part by interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S, the ACE2/L-SIGN/CD209 receptor on the type II alveolar cell of the lung. Infection of the DC by SARS CoV-2 can potentially explain the exuberant distal immunopathology seen in COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

original:
- "In a rapidly evolving pandemic such as COVID-19, theories which help unify disparate pre-clinical and clinical observations would be useful. The current pandemic and its pleotropic effects can be explained in part by interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S, the ACE2/L-SIGN/CD209 receptor on the type II alveolar cell of the lung, and the DC-SIGN receptor on the respiratory dendritic cell (DC) and associated endothelial cells. Infection of the DC by SARS-CoV-2 can potentially explain the exuberant distal immunopathology seen in COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
