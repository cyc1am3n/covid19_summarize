This stream of research is also referred to as more universally recognized term such as health services research in pharmacy. The health services research in pharmacy has increased manifold; however, the impact of this research is not visible at the global level. The editorial explains several issues on quality and quantity of evidence produced including how evidence produced could contribute to improve quality of care and patients&rsquo; health outcomes. It also narrates examples from the UK and Australia showing how health services research in pharmacy has made an impact on healthcare service delivery. The editorial argues that building an encyclopaedia in health services research in pharmacy is vital to enhance the visibility and impact of this research."
