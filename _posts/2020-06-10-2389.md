summary:
- "the U.S. faces shortages of personal protective equipment. Most arthroplasty surgeons use surgical helmet systems. The authors have begun retrofitting these helmets as PPE. They outline the conception, design, donning technique, and safety testing of the helmets being re-purposed. This paper is to outline the concept, design and donning techniques. Those who use loupes and headlights have difficulty using them in conjunction with face shields. Many hospitals have delayed elective arthres of COVID-19."

original:
- "Care for patients during COVID-19 poses challenges that require the protection of staff with recommendations that health care workers wear at minimum, an N95 mask or equivalent while performing an aerosol-generating procedure with a face shield. The United States faces shortages of personal protective equipment, and surgeons who use loupes and headlights have difficulty using these in conjunction with face shields. Most arthroplasty surgeons use surgical helmet systems, but in the current pandemic, many hospitals have delayed elective arthroplasty surgeries and the helmet systems are going unused. As a result, the authors have begun retrofitting these arthroplasty helmets to serve as personal protective equipment (PPE). The purpose of this paper is to outline the conception, design, donning technique, and safety testing of these arthroplasty helmets being re-purposed as PPE."
