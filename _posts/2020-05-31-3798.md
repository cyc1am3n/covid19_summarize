summary:
- "COVID-19 was transplanted for hepatocellular carcinoma three years ago. The patient came to clinic with symptoms of respiratory disease. His disease progressed rapidly from mild to critical illness. He was complicated by several nosocomial infections and multi-organ failure. Management of the disease presents complex challenges emphasizing the importance of strict prevention strategies. Despite multiple invasive procedures and rescue therapies, he succumbed to the disease."

original:
- "Liver injury is common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplantation. We describe a case of COVID-19 in a patient who had transplantation three years previously for hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient came to clinic with symptoms of respiratory disease; pharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were positive. His disease progressed rapidly from mild to critical illness and was complicated by several nosocomial infections and multi-organ failure. Despite multiple invasive procedures and rescue therapies, he succumbed to the disease. The management of COVID-19 in the post-transplant setting presents complex challenges emphasizing the importance of strict prevention strategies."
