summary:
- "Christian Drosten was going for a walk with his wife and 2-year-old son in front of his apartment block. He got on his bicycle for his daily commute to Charit?? University Hospital. His wife and son were going for walks instead of bringing him to the day care center. The hospital's Institute of Virology was studying exotic viruses, as always, but now one of those pathogens was killing patients in a hospital a few blocks away. Charit? University Hospital was closed, and some people wore masks on Monday morning to get on his bike for his commute to his son and went to the hospital."

original:
- "On a recent Monday morning, Christian Drosten said goodbye to his wife and 2-year-old son in front of his apartment block and got on his bicycle for his daily commute to Charit?? University Hospital here. It looked like a scene from normal daily life. But of course it wasn't. His wife was going for a walk with their child instead of bringing him to the day care center, which was closed. The Berlin streets Drosten traversed were eerily quiet, most shops were closed, and some people on the sidewalks wore masks. Charit??'s Institute of Virology, which Drosten heads, was studying exotic viruses, as always, but now one of those pathogens was killing patients in a hospital a few blocks away."
