summary:
- "fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan examinations to contribute in diagnosis of COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. LVAD population expecially if patients are currently living in a high density COVID-19 infected area. We report on the role of fluoresine 18 fluorodesoxyglukose (PFD) scans."

original:
- "We report on the role of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan examinations to contribute in the diagnosis of COVID-19 respiratory syndrome even in the case of asymptomatic left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients. Thus, warm caution and thoughtful approaches for timely detection should be taken for our delicate LVAD population expecially if patients are currently living in a high density COVID-19 infected area and the pontential intention for LVAD treatment is bridge to transplantation."
