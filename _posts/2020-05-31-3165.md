summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in neonate with COVID-19. The highest viral RNA copies in nasopharynx decreased over time. We report changes in viral load over time in a neonate who presented with fever, cough, and vomiting. RNA in stool, stool, saliva, plasma, and urine was high. Highest viral load in stool remained high in the neonate."
