summary:
- "the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the globe and is causing significant morbidity and mortality. Open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health care workers. A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions using the PICO format. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion."

original:
- "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the globe and is causing significant morbidity and mortality. Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health care workers (HCW). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCW. METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCW, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for non-urgent indications and, if necessary to perform, HCW should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients."
