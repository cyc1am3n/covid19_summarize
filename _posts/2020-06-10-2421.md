summary:
- "the department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients. The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines. A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning. Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis. Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented."

original:
- "COVID-19 has created an urgent need for reorganization and surge planning among departments of surgery across the USA. Review of the COVID-19 planning process and work products in preparation for a patient surge. Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented. The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines. The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning. A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited. Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis. Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation."
