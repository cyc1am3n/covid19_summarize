summary:
- "Those events reflected the emergence of a new form of environmentalism. Many of the themes present 50 years ago persist, but in the US environmental issues have become more politically polarized. It is unclear whether such value conflicts will persist in the future. The first Earth Day engaged millions of people in thousands of events around the US in 1970. In the past 50 years, the theme of the event persists, but it is unclear if such value conflict will persist."
