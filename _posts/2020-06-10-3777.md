summary:
- "A complete genome sequence was obtained for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strain isolated from an oropharyngeal swab specimen of a Nepalese patient. The strain had returned to Nepal after traveling to Wuhan, China. A complete sequence of genome sequences was obtained. a patient with the disease had returned from China to Nepal. It was isolated from a specimen of the patient who had returned in Wuhan."
