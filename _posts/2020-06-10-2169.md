summary:
- "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has developed in late 2019 and 2020. No vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now. All efforts at drug design and clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable. Anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19."

original:
- "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that has developed in late 2019 and 2020 is a serious threat to human health. With no vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable. Using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides (MAC) were predicted to be effective for COVID-19. Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19. We believe that treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to fight this emerging viral infection."
