summary:
- "the spread of the novel-Coronavirus infection worldwide represents a challenge for physicians. No approved therapy has demonstrated to have an impact in treating patients who develop severe respiratory insufficiency so far. The use of humanized anti-human inteleukine-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab seems a promising strategy for these patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
