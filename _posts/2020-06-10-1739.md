Practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists are negatively affected by the pandemic in March 2020. Study's aim was to evaluate the impact of the outbreak on German psychiatrists. 396 physicians returned the questionnaire (19 %). More than 60 % of participants felt restricted strongly or very strongly, more than 30 % were strongly and very strongly concerned."

original:
- "AIM: To date, to our knowledge there are no studies regarding attitudes and experiences of outpatient medical personnel during a pandemic. This study's aim was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 on German psychiatrists and neurologists. METHODS: An e-mail and fax-based short survey of 2,072 practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists was performed including Likert-type questions on personal burden and concerns, anticipated risk of infection, practice management as well as anxiety and sleep problems. RESULTS: 396 physicians returned the questionnaire (19 %). More than 60 % of the participants felt restricted strongly or very strongly, more than 30 % were strongly and very strongly concerned. They anticipated a high own risk of infection. However, 91 % did not report any contact with patients positively screened for COVID-19, which they were aware of. One third felt financially threatened and loss of business volume was anticipated. 18 % reported, that the pandemic triggers substantial anxiety. Sleep problems, which occur at least almost every night, were rarely reported (9 %). CONCLUSION: Practice-based psychiatrists and neurologists are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
