summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 has emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks in the Wuhan region. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir and ribavirin have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously showed effectiveness to inhibit the first stageof MERS-coronarivus viral cyclein human cells."

original:
- "In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Due to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the besttool to find therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stageof MERS-coronarivus viral cyclein human cells. This activity is conserved on the SARS-Cov-2,thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus."
