summary:
- "SARS-CoV2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization. AI and Big Data can help in handling the unprecedented amount of data derived from public health surveillance, epidemic outbreaks monitoring, trend now-casting/forecasting, regular situation briefing and updating from governmental institutions and organisms. The present review is aimed at overviewing the potential applications of AI and big Data in the global effort to manage it."

- "SARS-CoV2 is a novel coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization. Thanks to the latest advancements in the field of molecular and computational techniques and information and communication technologies (ICTs), artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data can help in handling the huge, unprecedented amount of data derived from public health surveillance, real-time epidemic outbreaks monitoring, trend now-casting/forecasting, regular situation briefing and updating from governmental institutions and organisms, and health facility utilization information. The present review is aimed at overviewing the potential applications of AI and Big Data in the global effort to manage the pandemic."
