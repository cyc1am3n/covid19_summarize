original:
- "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia was emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, this highly contagious coronavirus has been spreading worldwide with a rapid rise in the number of death tolls. The novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes with focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, we aimed to review the precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected to have NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff."
