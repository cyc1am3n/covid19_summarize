Patients have been described having CT findings most consistent with an early-stage (<7 days from symptoms onset) or an advanced stage (8-14 days from symptoms onset). We describe and illustrate those early and advanced stage CT findings from patients with documented COVID-19 who have been admitted to University Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana."
