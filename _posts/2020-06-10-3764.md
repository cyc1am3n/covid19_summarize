title: "SARS-CoV-2 shedding and infectivity &#x2013; Authors' reply"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30869-2"
author:
- Zhou, Fei; Fan, Guohui; Liu, Zhibo; Cao, Bin

summary:
- "Fei Zhou and colleagues estimated mean duration of viral shedding by assessing the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in patient samples. The presence of nucleic acid alone cannot be used to define shedding or infection potential. Assessing potential infectivity is a labour-intensive process. Nucleic acids alone can not be used for the shedding process, authors state. Identifying potential infection potential can be difficult, as the authors state is possible within their methods compared the mean duration. Fei and colleagues. Evaluating RNA. Effects."
