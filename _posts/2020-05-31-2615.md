original:
- "The spread of COVID-19 globally has caused a high rate of sickness, death, and uncertainty, leading many U.S. colleges and universities to move instruction online for the time being and possibly through the end of the academic year and maybe beyond. When the global pandemic hit the United States, institutions struggled to quickly make decisions about how to deal with international students on campus, as well as how and when to pull American students studying abroad out of programs and bring them back to campus, without potentially spreading the disease through a healthy student population ? and with how best to monitor and advise students in the wake of a global emergency."
