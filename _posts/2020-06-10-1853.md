summary:
- "outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been posing a significant threat to global human health. Chinese patients with COVID-19 rarely have liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis unless pre-existing advanced liver disease was present. There is insufficient evidence for SARS-coV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury. The clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients have been widely reported. Increasing evidence has been reported since December 2019 posed a major threat to human health in China. C.S."

original:
- "An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (2019 coronavirus disease, COVID-19) since December 2019, from Wuhan, China, has been posing a significant threat to global human health. The clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported. Increasing evidence has witnessed the frequent incident liver injury in COVID-19 patients, and it is often manifested as transient elevation of serum aminotransferases; however, the patients seldom have liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis, unless pre-existing advanced liver disease was present. The underlying mechanisms of liver injury in cases of COVID-19 might include psychological stress, systemic inflammation response, drug toxicity, and progression of pre-existing liver diseases. However, there is insufficient evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury in COVID-19 at present. The clinical, pathological and laboratory characteristics as well as underlying pathophysiology and etiology of liver injury in COVID-19 remain largely unclear. In this review, we highlight these important issues based on the recent developments in the field, for optimizing the management and treatment of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19."
