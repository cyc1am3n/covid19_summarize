- "As of April 7, 2020, approximately 1,300,000 cases and 80,000 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in > 180 countries/territories. Healthcare infrastructures and resources, particularly as it relates to the care of the most critically ill patients, are currently being strained globally. In this context, however, there has been little clinical guidance or information regarding life-threatening conditions requiring emergency surgery that cannot be delayed. We herein present a case of acute type A aortic dissection with COVID-19 in order to highlight the clinical implications of a true emergent procedure during the COVID-19 outbreak."
