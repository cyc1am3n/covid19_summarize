summary:
- "183 consecutive patients with confirmed NCP in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The overall mortality was 11.5%, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time compared to survivors on admission (P????.05); 71.4% and 0.6% survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay."

original:
- "In the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, significantly abnormal coagulation parameters in severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) cases were a concern. OBJECTIVES: To describe the coagulation feature of patients with NCP. METHODS: Conventional coagulation results and outcomes of 183 consecutive patients with confirmed NCP in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The overall mortality was 11.5%, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time compared to survivors on admission (P??<??.05); 71.4% of non-survivors and 0.6% survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP are common in deaths with NCP."
