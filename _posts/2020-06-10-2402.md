- "Currently, it is commonly reported that COVID-19 patients are associated with conjunctival congestion and other symptoms, and the transmission route or high-risk diseases of ophthalmology and high-risk working status are speculated. Are conjunctival congestion or conjunctival related symptoms in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus definitely related the novel coronavirus? Conjunctival congestion is one of the common clinical signs of various types of conjunctivitis. The symptoms and signs of conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients may be related to a variety of factors. Therefore, conjunctival symptoms should not be associated with 2019 novel coronavirus without evidence. ( Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56: )."
