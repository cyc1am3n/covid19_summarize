summary:
- "the infectious disease research community in China has become a major global contributor. During the current global pandemic of COVID-19, our colleagues in China made key achievements to combat this devastating virus. The collection of manuscripts in this ACS Infectious Diseases Special Issue invited contributions from corresponding authors located in China. We would like to encourage continued submission of high quality research. Views expressed in this editorial are those of the author and not necessarily the views of the ACS."

original:
- "In the past decades, great efforts have been made to significantly improve the basic research infrastructure and the expertise of infectious disease research in China. Because of these efforts, the infectious disease research community in China has become a major global contributor. During the current global pandemic of COVID-19, our colleagues in China made key achievements (including epidemiology analysis, clinical investigation, structural biology, antiviral discovery, etc.) to battle against this devastating virus, reflecting the capability and the sense of responsibility of our Chinese colleagues. The collection of manuscripts in this ACS Infectious Diseases Special Issue on Infectious Disease Research in China invited contributions from corresponding authors located in China, spanning a wide range of topics covering anti-HIV/Flavivirus/enterovirus and antibacterial agent discovery and the understanding of the pathogen life cycle and host innate immune response as well as new techniques for antiviral screening. I thank the authors, the reviewers, and our editorial colleagues for their great contributions to this special issue. Although we do not include COVID-19 research in this special issue due to time limitations, we would like to encourage the continued submission of high quality research on COVID-19, and these studies will have our highest priority. Views expressed in this editorial are those of the author and not necessarily the views of the ACS."
