title: "Potential of Heparin and Nafamostat Combination Therapy for COVID-19"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14858"
author:
- Asakura, Hidesaku; Ogawa, Haruhiko

summary:
- "heparin anticoagulant therapy lowers the mortality rate in patients present with markedly elevated concentrations of D-dimer 1. Tang et al. recently reported that abnormal coagulation may influence the prognosis of COVID-19. The authors reported in that article 1) and a previous article 2) that the anomaly seen in non-survivors differs from the anomalous coagulations typically seen in other severe infectious diseases."

original:
- "Tang et al. recently reported that (Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis), in COVID-19 infections caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), heparin anticoagulant therapy lowers the mortality rate in patients who present with markedly elevated concentrations of D-dimer 1). In other words, abnormal coagulation may influence the prognosis of COVID-19. This is extremely interesting. The article did not describe to what extent heparin improves the abnormal coagulation and further studies by this group are anticipated. The authors reported in that article 1) and a previous article 2) that the abnormal coagulation seen in non-survivors of COVID-19 clearly differs from the abnormal coagulation typically seen in other severe infectious diseases."
