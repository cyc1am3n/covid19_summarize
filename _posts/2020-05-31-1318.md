summary:
- "physical exercise promotes neuroprotection and reduces the risk of developing communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases. A single session of physical exercise may induce a transient imbalance of cell homeostasis. Multiple physical exercise sessions will improve immunosurveillance and immunocompetence. Immun cells from the central nervous system will acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype."

original:
- "A wide array of molecular pathways has been investigated during the past decade in order to understand the mechanisms by which the practice of physical exercise promotes neuroprotection and reduces the risk of developing communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases. While a single session of physical exercise may induce a transient imbalance of cell homeostasis, repeated physical exercise sessions will improve immunosurveillance and immunocompetence. Additionally, immune cells from the central nervous system will acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype, protecting central functions from age-induced cognitive decline. This review highlights the exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect on the prevention or treatment of common chronic clinical and experimental settings. It also suggests the use of pterins in biological fluids as sensitive biomarkers to follow the anti-inflammatory effect of physical exercise."
