summary:
- "the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult. Patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on specifics of each patient during epidemic situation."

original:
- "Pharmacists around the world can expect to be affected by the coronavirus, especially those who provide care for older people who are at a much higher risk for grave consequences from the virus. It is critical that pharmacists maintain awareness of the evolving pandemic and access reliable information to remain familiar with developments. The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult. Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards. Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging examination. Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the specifics of each patient during epidemic situation."
