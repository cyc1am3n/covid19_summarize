summary:
- "data collected from individual cases reported by the media were used to estimate the distribution of the incubation period of travelers to Hubei versus that of nontravelers. The duration of quarantine should be extended to 3 weeks. Because a longer and more volatile incubations period has been observed in travelers, the duration should be longer. During quarantine, quarantine is recommended for travelers. Data collected from the individual cases compared to nontraveler cases."
