summary:
- "Yang and colleagues published the relevance of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients and its association with mortality in this condition in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The authors are to be applauded for the largest so-far analysis in the epidemiology. There may be several other findings in this interesting paper which deserves mention. Among the findings are the ?higher? platelet counts for an illness as severe as COVId-19 is unusual and likely points towards liver activation and the relevance in the study in the journal of. the. in the publication."

original:
- "Yang and colleagues published the relevance of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients and its association with mortality in this condition in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.1 The authors are to be applauded for the largest so-far analysis in the epidemiology of thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. In addition to the association with mortality, there may be several other findings in this interesting paper which deserves mention. First of all, the study confirms that COVID-19 is not associated with significant thrombocytopenia (only 20.7% had counts less than 125 x 109/L, the lower range in this study).2,3 The ?higher? platelet counts for an illness as severe as COVID-19 is unusual and likely points towards liver activation and thrombopoietin release."
