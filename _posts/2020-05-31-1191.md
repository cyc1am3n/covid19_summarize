Piedmont one of the areas most severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, with large numbers of people infected and related mortality. In the region, specialists responsible for OUD care identified the risk that the existing care system exposed patients to. Teams designed and implemented innovation approaches to enable continuation of care and reduce the inherent system risk to patients with OUD."
