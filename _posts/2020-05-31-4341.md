summary:
- "Italy, especially the northern regions, was hit by an epidemic of the new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus that spread from China between December 2019 and January 2020. The entire healthcare system had to respond promptly in a very short time to an exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by COVID-19. It was the first time Italy has been hit by the new Corona virus that spreads from China from December 2019 to January 2020, with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units."
