summary:
- "social distancing and shelter-in-place order are among the measures implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. More than 60% of the infected cases occurring in a public hospital in Hanoi are linked to food delivery of mildly-ill or presymptomatic non-clinical staff working at the hospital cafeteria. This has raised a concern that food delivery has a great potential to contribute to the spreading of the disease. Food delivery has been touted as a useful, convenient and safe means to reduce the risk of preventing the spread spark surge in food delivery measures. Shutdown of non-essential services."

original:
- "Social distancing and shelter-in-place order are among the measures implemented to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 [1]. Shutdown of all non-essential services and restriction of restaurants to takeout in response to the social distancing measures spark surge in food delivery service. Such a service has been touted as being a useful, convenient and safe means to reduce the risk of exposure to infection sources of the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, this distribution method may still pose a potential risk of spreading the disease. Very recently, we have reported more than 60% of the infected cases occurring in a public hospital in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, are linked to food delivery of mildly-ill or presymptomatic non-clinical staff working at the hospital cafeteria [2]. This has raised a concern that food delivery has a great potential to contribute to the spread of the disease [3]. While more and more people adhere to the shelter-in-place order, delivery workers are ordering and delivering foods for their customers."
