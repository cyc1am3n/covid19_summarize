summary:
- "weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising. The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. Evidence has recently emerged regarding an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 with worse prognosis in patients with obesity."

original:
- "Evidence has lately emerged regarding an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 with worse prognosis in patients with obesity, especially among the young. Weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising. The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and a possible local, detrimental effect within the lung. Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.
