summary:
- "I am writing this on 27th March as the world is plunging further into the coronavirus crisis. My medical consultant said that he was apprehensive about the 'calm before the storm' that our health services face. He was deadly serious. At a follow-up tele-consult with his medical consultant recently, he said that his health services are in virtual 'lockdown' in Australia. The virus continues to spread across the world."
