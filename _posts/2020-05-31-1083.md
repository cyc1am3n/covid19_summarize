summary:
- "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a Personal Protective Equipment Burn Rate calculator for hospitals to project future PPE supplies. This tool requires hospital systems have an understanding of daily PPE usage patterns and does not differentiate usage at various healthcare provider (HCP) and patient capacities. Vital factors that affect PPE supply, namely decontamination, are not considered in the CDC PPE Burn Rate Calculator. PSOs completed a survey of all providers present on the unit on day and night shifts. The tool requires hospitals to develop a personal protective equipment burn rate calculator for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of PPE."

original:
- "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has presented a severe strain as well as shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) (1). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a Personal Protective Equipment Burn Rate calculator for hospitals to project future PPE supplies (2). This tool requires that hospital systems have an understanding of daily PPE usage patterns. This calculator also does not differentiate usage at various healthcare provider (HCP) and patient capacities. Vital factors that affect PPE supplies, namely decontamination, are not considered in the CDC PPE Burn Rate Calculator. We designed a sampling approach to steward our current PPE supply and develop an institutional burn rate calculator to project usage patterns at various patient/provider volumes. We implemented a sampling process that utilized providers already present on a dedicated COVID-19 patient intensive care unit (ICU). We sampled continuously from weekdays to weekends to capture multiple use patterns. We previously implemented patient safety officers (PSO) on each unit caring for COVID-19 patients to monitor infection control practices (e.g. donning and doffing of PPE under extended use and reuse policies). PSOs completed a survey of all providers present on the unit on day and night shifts. This survey included: provider role, number of patients under the HCP care, number of COVID-19/PUI patients under HCP care, number of contacts with COVID-19/PUI patients, number of patients for which HCP uses N95 mask, number of N95 masks used during a shift, number of N95 masks sent for decontamination, number of N95 masks disposed during a shift, number of gowns used during a shift, number of gowns disposed, number of disposable face shields used during a shift, number of disposable face shields disposed during a shift, number of disposable eye protection measures worn during a shift, number of disposable eye protection measures disposed during a shift, and number of aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) for which the HCP participated for a COVID-19/PUI patient. Once sampling was completed, we were able to develop our calculator"
