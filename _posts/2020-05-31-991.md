summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus of the Coronaviridiae family that represents a major global health issue. Mechanisms implicated in virus/host cells interaction are central for cell infection and replication that in turn lead to disease onset and local damage. Molecular mechanisms that promote interaction between virus and host are described. We further explore the impact of underlying medical conditions and therapies including renin-angiotensin inhibitors on modulating ACE 2."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus of the Coronaviridiae family that represents a major global health issue. Mechanisms implicated in virus/host cells interaction are central for cell infection and replication that in turn lead to disease onset and local damage. To enter airway and lung epithelia, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE2 receptors by spike (S) glycoproteins. Molecular mechanisms that promote interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and host with particular focus on virus cell entry receptor ACE2 are described. We further explore the impact of underlying medical conditions and therapies including renin-angiotensin inhibitors on modulating ACE 2, which is the major SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor."
