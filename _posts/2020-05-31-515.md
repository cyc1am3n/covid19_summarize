original:
- "In late December 2019, China reported cases of respiratory illness in humans that involved a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. On March 20, 2020, the first COronaVIrusDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil was diagnosed and by now we present the report on the first case of COVID among transplant recipients in our country. A liver and kidney transplant patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without respiratory failure was treated in a clinical multimodal strategy consisting of symptomatic support therapy, immunosuppression reduction, use of anti-coronavirus drugs and heparin leading to a progressive improvement of patient symptoms till discharge. The authors also present a comprehensive review of published cases."
