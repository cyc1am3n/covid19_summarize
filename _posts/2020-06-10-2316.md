summary:
- "COVID-19 is a major crisis, disrupting all facets of human life. The pandemic creates additional concerns about one?s role in providing care, the effectiveness and limitations of medical care, and personal vulnerability to infection and asymptomatic disease spread. PIF defines how learners come to ?think, act, and feel like a physician. A crisis catalyzes transformative learning by serving as a disorienting dilemma."

original:
- "COVID-19 is a major crisis, disrupting all facets of human life. For medical professionals and trainees, the pandemic creates additional concerns about one?s role in providing care, the effectiveness and limitations of medical care, and personal vulnerability to infection and asymptomatic disease spread. These challenges can shape medical students? professional identity formation (PIF), defined as how learners come to ?think, act, and feel like a physician.?1 Medical students develop their identities as emerging professionals through training, and a crisis such as a pandemic alters, impedes, or accelerates this process. A crisis catalyzes transformative learning by serving as a disorienting dilemma, and educators can harness this opportunity for growth."
