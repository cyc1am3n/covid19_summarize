summary:
- "the COVID pandemic has necessitated modifications to pediatric orthopaedic practice. It is critical to balance benefits of alterations to current practice to reduce chances of COV infection, with potential long-term impact on patients. Early experiences of the pandemie have provided opportunity to take proactive and preventive measures to protect all involved. General principles include limiting procedures to urgent cases such as traumatic injuries. Non-operative methods should be considered where possible."

original:
- "The COVID pandemic has necessitated modifications to pediatric orthopaedic practice to protect patients, families and healthcare workers, and to minimize viral transmission. It is critical to balance benefits of alterations to current practice to reduce chances of COVID infection, with the potential long-term impact on patients. Early experiences of the pandemic from orthopaedic surgeons in China, Singapore and Italy have provided opportunity to take proactive and preventive measures to protect all involved in pediatric orthopaedic care. These guidelines, based on expert opinion and best available evidence, provide a framework for management of pediatric orthopaedic patients during the COVID pandemic. General principles include limiting procedures to urgent cases such as traumatic injuries, and deferring outpatient visits during the acute phase of the pandemic. Non-operative methods should be considered where possible. For patients with developmental or chronic orthopaedic conditions, it may be possible to delay treatment for 2 to 4 months without substantial detrimental long-term impact."
