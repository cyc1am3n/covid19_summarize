summary:
- "the COVID19 crisis has totally upended clinical medicine and the practice of rheumatology. Despite the mounting challenges of managing an exploding population of coronavirus infected patients and caregivers, we must find innovative ways to foster our trainees' professional development. In a matter of weeks, the crisis has completely upended the practice. We need to replace these critical teaching and training elements."

original:
- "In a matter of weeks, the COVID19 crisis has totally upended clinical medicine and the practice of rheumatology. Our old ways of seeing patients in person, precepting fellows in clinic or on the consult service, and leading in-person interactive teaching rounds are gone for now and possibly for good. But how can we replace these critical teaching and training elements? Despite the mounting challenges of managing an exploding population of coronavirus infected patients and caregivers, we must find innovative ways to foster our trainees' professional development."
