summary:
- "Cook et al. would like to commend Cook for their excellent, thorough and timely guidelines for airway management during this time. The guidelines have already proven invaluable in training with simulation and also in performing tracheal intubations in critically ill adults adapted for COVID-19. Cook says the guidelines encourage safe, accurate and swift performance. This is the first step of their algorithm for traheal. intubation algorithm."

- "I would like to commend Cook et al. [1] for their excellent, thorough and timely guidelines for airway management during this time. In particular I would like to commend the principles of airway management to encourage safe, accurate and swift performance. These guidelines have already proven invaluable in training with simulation and also in performing tracheal intubations in patients. I would like to highlight the very important point, the first step of their algorithm for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults adapted for COVID-19 which states that staff must don full checked personal protective equipment (PPE)."
