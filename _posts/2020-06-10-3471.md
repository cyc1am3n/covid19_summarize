summary:
- "Efforts should be made to provide best evidence based care, this will mean revisiting old techniques and risk stratifying patients on a case by case basis. Recent experience from colleagues internationally has shown that even the wealthiest health care infrastructure is at best fragile. This paper will add to the debate and hopefully provide a framework to decision making in OMFS trauma care during this difficult time. We hope this paper will help us understand the dilemmas facing surgeons in a difficult time, we hope. The paper aims to provide evidence-based care priority, safety of staff, patient safety and the most appropriate use of available resources."
