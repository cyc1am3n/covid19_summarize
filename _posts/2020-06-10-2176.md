summary:
- "the ratio of reported COVID-19 cases to model-based predictions was provided. The data until March 9, 2020 was not sufficient to provide a robust estimate. We have estimated under-reporting of the novel coronavirus until March 9. For the U.S., the data was comparatively much better than other countries. Our retrospective models-based estimations will be helpful in the assessment of pandemic preparedness required."

original:
- "We have estimated under-reporting of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 until March 9, 2020, in various countries until the first peak occurred in each of the countries that have reported 500 or more cases of COVID-19 as of March 9, 2020. Our retrospective model-based estimations of under-reporting (including those due to under-diagnosis) will be helpful in the assessment of pandemic preparedness required. The ratio of reported COVID-19 cases to model-based predictions of COVID-19 for eight major countries who have reported 500 or more cases up to March 9, 2020, were provided (See Column l in Table 1). COVID-19 Reporting in France, Germany Italy, and South Korea was comparatively much better than other countries. For the U.S. The data until March 9, 2020 was not sufficient to provide a robust estimate."
