summary:
- "Ageing adults (65+) with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. It is very important that health services - particularly health services providing palliative care - are proximately available. The spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of ageing adults with disabilities. Travel times from priority areas to (i) pallative medicine, and (ii) hospital services were calculated."

original:
- "Ageing adults (65+) with disability are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and upon contracting, are a cohort most likely to require palliative care. Therefore, it is very important that health services - particularly health services providing palliative care - are proximately available. Treating the Melbourne metropolitan area as a case-study, a spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of ageing adults (65+) with disability, and high barriers to accessing primary health services. After, travel times from priority areas to (i) palliative medicine, and (ii) hospital services were calculated. The geographic dispersion of areas with people vulnerable to COVID-19 with poor access to palliative care and health services are clarified. Unique methods of health service delivery are required to ensure that vulnerable populations in under-serviced metropolitan areas receive prompt and adequate care. The spatial methodology employed can be implemented in different contexts to support evidence-based COVID-19 and pandemic palliative care service decisions."
