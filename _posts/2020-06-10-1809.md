original:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a new corona virus responsible for the pandemic named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease causes severe acute respiratory syndromes with a significant morbidity and mortality. We provide a review with a focus on COVID-19 in dermatology. We discuss triage of suspected infectious patients, protection of medical doctors and nurses. We discuss the available data on cutaneous symptoms, although disease-specific symptoms have yet not been observed. COVID-19 is a challenge for the treatment of dermatologic patients, either with severe inflammatory disorders or with skin cancer. The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process. Last but not least education in dermatology for students will be temporarily not be possible in the classical settings. COVID-19, although not a skin disease by itself has an immense impact on dermatology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
