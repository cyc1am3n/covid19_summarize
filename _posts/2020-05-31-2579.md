summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread changes across all of healthcare. The impacts on the delivery of orthopaedic services has been challenged as a result. Service lines such as adult reconstruction and lower limb arthroplasty have stopped or substantially limited elective surgeries. In order to ensure and provide adequate health care resources, service lines have been forced to re-engineer care processes for a high-volume of patients."

original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread changes across all of healthcare. The impacts on the delivery of orthopaedic services has been challenged as a result. In order to ensure and provide for adequate health care resources in terms of hospital capacity, personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), service lines such as adult reconstruction and lower limb arthroplasty have stopped or substantially limited elective surgeries and have been forced to re-engineer care processes for a high-volume of patients. Herein, we summarize the similar approaches by two arthroplasty divisions in high volume academic referral centers in 1) the cessation of elective surgeries, 2) workforce restructuring, 3) phased delivery of outpatient and inpatient care, and 4) educational restructuring."
