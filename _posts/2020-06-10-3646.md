summary:
- "chilblain-like lesions in Italy contemporarily to COVID-19 epidemic. We created a Google form aimed to collect information about patients presenting with these singular clinical findings. An easy to access tool was chosen by the investigators in order to permit the other colleagues to spend the least amount of time, given the severe health emergency. The investigators created an easy-to-access and quick tool to allow the other co-workers to spend most of the time. Due to the well known lockdown-related difficulties to visit the patients in Italy have recently noticed an outbreak of COVId-19 epidemic in Italy."
