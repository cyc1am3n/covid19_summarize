summary:
- "Taiwanese people contacted with more than 3,000 passengers disembarked at Keelung dock, Taiwan for one-day tour on Jan. 31, 2020. The smart contact tracing based mobile sensor data cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data was used to identify 627,386 potential contact persons with the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis."

- "Low infection and case-fatality rate has been so far observed in Taiwan. One of major success is attributed to making a better use of big data analytics in efficient contacting tracing and management and surveillance of those who required quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application with big data analytics to Taiwanese people who contacted with more than 3,000 passengers disembarked at Keelung dock, Taiwan for one-day tour on Jan. 31, 2020, five days before the outbreak of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Feb. 5 2020 after an index case identified on Jan. 20th. METHODS: The smart contact tracing based mobile sensor data cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data was used to identify 627,386 potential contact persons with the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via short message service (SMS) message and SARS-CoV-2 test were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claimed big data were linked to follow up the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to screen for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of Feb. 29, total 67 contacts who were had been tested by RT-PCR were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less respiratory syndrome cases and pneumonia also found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until Mar. 10. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert message for self-restriction, and the follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing."
