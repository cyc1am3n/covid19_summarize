original:
- "Given the succession of communications in scientific and popular circuits, tending to take for granted a role for vitamin D in the control of the coronavirus pandemic, the authors conducted an analysis of the literature currently available in order to recognize what is supported by opinions personal and what evidence of effectiveness. At the end of the bibliographic survey there is the current absence of evidence of efficacy in favor of vitamin D in the treatment of coronavirus infection in its various expressions. The diffusion of personal opinions as if they were evidence can be a disturbing factor for adequate assistance and for correct research."
