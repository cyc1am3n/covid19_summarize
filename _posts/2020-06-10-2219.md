title: "SARS-CoV-2: an Emerging Coronavirus that Causes a Global Threat"
link: "https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45053"
author:

summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, but we know little about it. In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of the outbreak. We highlight bats as potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus. Advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized briefly. The advances in the developing development of the new alternative therapies are also briefed."

original:
- "An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, we know little about it. In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus. Furthermore, we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2. We highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus, but their roles are waiting for further investigation. Finally, the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized."
