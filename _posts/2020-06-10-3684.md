summary:
- "Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. A prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. In this study, a prediction model has been proposed. The prediction model will be used to evaluate infection risk."
