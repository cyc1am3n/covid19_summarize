summary:
- "the current reports of COVID-19 focus on the respiratory system. In three cases, intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved. The current reports focus on respiratory system, but intestinal infections caused by SARS are also worthy of attention. Here we report persistence of intestinal infection in three cases. COV-2 infections lead to pneumonia. This leads to pneumonia resolution. We also report intestinal infections."
