original:
- "Public health nurses (PHNs) are on the frontline of the public health crisis the world now knows as the COVID-19 pandemic. They serve on mobile strike teams investigating case-contacts, deliver education on self-isolation and quarantine through hotlines and home visits, and interpret the rapidly shifting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They are reliable and proven responders during infectious disease emergencies, providing safe, effective, and nondiscriminatory care to the communities in which they serve."
