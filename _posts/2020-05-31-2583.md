summary:
- "the dumping of milk, the offering of hospitality size goods in grocery stores, and the closure of processing facilities are examples of the disruptions caused by the pandemic to the dairy, poultry, and egg sectors. These supply management sectors are more resilient to the impacts of COVID-19 than other sectors as producers are generally more financially stable, losses are pooled, and production/marketing efforts are coordinated.
