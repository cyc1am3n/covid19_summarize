original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched health care resources to a point of crisis throughout the world. To answer the call for care, health care workers in a diverse range of specialties are being retasked to care for patients with COVID-19. Consequently, specialty services have had to adapt to decreased staff available for coverage coupled with a need to remain available for specialty-specific emergencies, which now require a dynamic definition. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe their experiences and share lessons learned regarding triage of patients, staff safety, workforce management, and the psychological impact as they have adapted to a new reality in the Department of Neurosurgery at Montefiore Medical Center, a COVID-19 hotspot in New York City. The authors have informed the journal that they agree that both Adam Ammar and Ariel D. Stock completed the intellectual and other work typical of the first author. Dedication: The authors dedicate this paper to the memory of James T. Goodrich MD, PhD, who succumbed to COVID-19 on March 30, 2020. He was a master surgeon, compassionate caregiver, dedicated mentor and consummate gentleman. He was a beacon of the profession and will be sorely missed. Funding/Support: None reported. Other disclosures: None reported. Ethical approval: Reported as not applicable.
