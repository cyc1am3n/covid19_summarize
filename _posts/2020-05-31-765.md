summary:
- "3 patients with coronavirus disease had a decline in respiratory status during their hospital course. They responded well to intravenous steroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonist therapy. Patients later showed development of persistent hypoxia with increased levels of d-dimer levels and were given a diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms. We report 3 patients who had decreased respiratory status in hospital course that responded well. These patients later showed signs of hypoxia."
