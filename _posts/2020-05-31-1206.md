summary:
- "surgical drain was replaced with a self-removing, passive drain dressing to facilitate same-day discharge and telehealth postoperative follow-up. Patients return to the outpatient clinic for drain removal. The patient removed the dressing and drain at home during a postoperative visit on postoperative day 4. Small practice adaptations such as this can help reduce unnecessary exposure for patients, their caregivers, and health care staff. When thoughtfully applied in appropriate clinical context, small practice adaptions like this can facilitate teleHealth solutions that diminished exposure during unilateral neck dissection. Surgical drain dressing. Patient removed the drain. Postoperative follow up."

original:
- "Telehealth postoperative visits are an attractive strategy to minimize exposure, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The use of a surgical drain often prevents this minimal-exposure approach in that patients return to the outpatient clinic for drain removal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following unilateral neck dissection, the customary closed-suction drain was replaced with a self-removing, passive drain dressing to facilitate same-day discharge and telehealth postoperative follow-up. The patient removed the dressing and drain at home during a telehealth visit on postoperative day 4 and she healed favorably without any signs of infection or seroma. CONCLUSIONS: When thoughtfully applied in the appropriate clinical context, small practice adaptations like this can facilitate telehealth solutions that diminish unnecessary exposure for patients, their caregivers, and health care staff."
