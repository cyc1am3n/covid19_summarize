original:
- "The world is presently under an emergency situation because of the COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and is predicted to be affected significantly over a longer time period. Our paper aims to provide detailed reporting and analyses of the present rapid responses to COVID-19 in Indonesia. We particularly highlight the progress of governments, key organisations and community responses to COVID-19 between January and March 2020. We outline the gaps and limitations in the responses, based on our rapid analysis of media contents, from government speeches and reports, social and mass media platforms. We present our recommendations toward more rapid effective, and comprehensive responses."
