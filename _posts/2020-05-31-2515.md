original:
- "The COVID-19 global pandemic is not even over yet but it has already taught us a lot of lessons - the hard way. The vast majority of the global community has blamed the Chinese Illegal wildlife markets for the origin of this pandemic. Through careful scientific analysis, I have explained in this article that we don't need such wildlife markets for these kinds of outbreaks to occur in the future. I have also explained how India which is the second-most populous country in the world, could be the origin of the next outbreak, even though such wildlife markets are either very rare or do not exist at all in India."
