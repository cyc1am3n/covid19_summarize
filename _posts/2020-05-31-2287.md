original:
- "At its core, differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV is centred around clients? needs and expectations and relieving unnecessary burdens on the health system. In the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines, it was acknowledged that adaptations to the delivery of HIV services were necessary to achieve the ?treat all? recommendation. This transition from a ?one-size-fits-all approach? to DSD means modifying the location, frequency and package of services as well as the cadre providing services, considering the clinical needs, specific population and the context including urbanicity, stability of context (for example high migration, conflict, or pandemic) and type of HIV epidemic."
