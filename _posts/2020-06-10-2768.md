summary:
- "China diagnosed the first patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019. The following development of the epidemic had a huge impact on China and the whole world. All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation. For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole process of diagnosis can not be carried out as usual due to the epidemic. We only offer some preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and discussion."

original:
- "In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and the following development of the epidemic had a huge impact on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due to the epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention should be very carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic changes and further understanding of new coronavirus pneumonia. Here, we only offer some preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and discussion."
