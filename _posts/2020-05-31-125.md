summary:
- "the full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. This perspective paper reviews current COVID19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential therapies. The perspective paper examines the potential therapies, care considerations unique to HCT recipients and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices across transplantation centers."

- "The full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. This perspective paper reviews the following: current COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential therapies; care considerations unique to HCT recipients; and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through facilitating shared learning and experience across transplantation centers."
