summary:
- "the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that causes infection with a potentially fatal outcome. Dendrimers are highly branched molecules that can be added to antiviral preparations to improve their delivery. The polycationic dendrimer containing primary amine showed a 17.36% to 29.75% decrease in MERS- CoV plaque formation. In contrast, the cationic cytotoxic to Vero cells were cytotoxicity. Studies on identifying anti-MERS is a virus. Corona virus causes infection."

original:
- "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that causes infection with a potentially fatal outcome. Dendrimers are highly branched molecules that can be added to antiviral preparations to improve their delivery, as well as their intrinsic antiviral activity. Studies on identifying anti-MERS-CoV agents are few. There are three types of polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate (generations 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5), hydroxyl (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5), and succinamic acid (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5). The polycationic dendrimers containing primary amine (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) were used to assess their antiviral activity with the MERS-CoV plaque inhibition assay. The hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17.36% to 29.75% decrease in MERS-CoV plaque formation. The most potent inhibition of MERS-CoV plaque formation was seen by G(1.5)-16COONa (40.5% inhibition), followed by G(5)-128SA (39.77% inhibition). In contrast, the cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic to Vero cells. Polyanionic dendrimers can be added to antiviral preparations to improve the delivery of antivirals, as well as the intrinsic antiviral activity. This article is protected by copyright.
