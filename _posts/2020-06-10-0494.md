original:
- "Doctors, nurses, and other medical staff are greatly concerned about nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Environmental contamination is a possible source of nosocomial transmission [1, 2]. However, it is unclear how effective environmental cleaning is against SARS-CoV-2. A 75-year-old man infected with SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed as having COVID-19 during the quarantine period on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He was transferred directly to our hospital on February 11, 2020. He resided in patient Room A for 2 days, then was moved to Room B, where he stayed for 19 days. After cleaning the rooms thoroughly with disinfectant (Rely+On Virkon, LANXESS, or RUBYSTA in Japan), we tested a total of 15 areas that were in close contact with the patient and medical staff. Swabs were used to transfer five environmental samples from Room A and 10 samples from Room B to universal transport media (Copan, Murrieta, CA). Cleaning was conducted immediately after the patient left the rooms. Environmental sampling was conducted within 5 days and 30 min after the patient left Rooms A and B, respectively"
