summary:
- "MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans. Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. The infection is a significative risk to the public health in the Middle East."
