summary:
- "ILROG guidelines for using radiation therapy in hematological malignancies are widely used in many countries. The emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in limitations of treatment resources. In recognition of the need to also reduce the exposure of patients and staff to potential infection with COVD-19, the task force has made recommendations for alternative radiation treatment schemes. It is informed by adhering to acceptable radiobiological parameters and clinical tolerability."

original:
- "The ILROG guidelines for using radiation therapy in hematological malignancies are widely used in many countries. The emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in limitations of treatment resources. Furthermore, in recognition of the need to also reduce the exposure of patients and staff to potential infection with COVID-19, the ILROG task force has made recommendations for alternative radiation treatment schemes. The emphasis is on maintaining clinical efficacy and safety by increasing the dose per fraction while reducing the number of daily treatments. The guidance is informed by adhering to acceptable radiobiological parameters and clinical tolerability. The options for delaying or omitting RT in some hematological categories are also discussed."
