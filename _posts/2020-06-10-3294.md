title: "Ethical framework for head and neck cancer care impacted by COVID-19"

author:

summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has upended head and neck cancer care delivery in ways unforeseen and unprecedented. The impact of these changes parallels other fields in oncology, but is disproportionate due to protective measures and limitations on potentially aerosolizing procedures and related interventions specific to the upper aerodigestive tract. Moral and professional dimensions of providing ethically appropriate and consistent care for our patients are considered herein for heads and neck oncologists providers."
