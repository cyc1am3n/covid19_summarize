summary:
- "the ventilator can be assembled by a nonexpert as a homemade solution without the need for specific equipment or technology. The system is novel, inexpensive, has a reduced reliance on external power, and is very easy to maintain. It can be used for COVID-19 patients in emergencies and to prevent massive loss of life in resource-poor environments."
