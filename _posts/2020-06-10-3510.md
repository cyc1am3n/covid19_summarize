summary:
- "psychotropic medication may be jeopardized due to the COVID19 pandemic. Here, we discuss five considerations arising from clinical experience and pharmacological background knowledge. We discuss five factors to enable safe and well informed psychopharmacotherapy during the COVD-19-specific psychopharmacology guidelines. One underlying reason is the lack of psychotropic medications. There are no guidelines for psychotropic drugs."
