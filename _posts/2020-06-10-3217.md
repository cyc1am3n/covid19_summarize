title: "Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and 2019-nCoV"

summary:
- "ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current 2019-nCoV pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARB may be included as additional therapy for 2019-NCoV patients. Angiotensin Receptor Blockers exhibit major pleiotropic protection effects beyond their antihypertensive properties, including those from coronavirus."

ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections, including those from coronavirus. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. For these reasons ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current 2019-nCoV pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for 2019-nCoV patients."
