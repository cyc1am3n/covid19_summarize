summary:
- "the outbreak of the COVID-19 in a region with high incidence and prevalence of disease. The selection of procedures for interventional radiology, preparation of staff and interventional suite before the arrival of patients, facility ventilation systems and intra- and post-procedural workflow optimization are described. These precautions may increase the cost of the equipment and prolong procedural times and increase technical difficulties. This is a single-center report on coordinated staff and handling of patients during the outbreak."

original:
- "This is a single-center report on coordination of staff and handling of patients during the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in a region with high incidence and prevalence of disease. The selection of procedures for interventional radiology (IR), preparation of staff and interventional suite before the arrival of patients, the facility ventilation systems and intra- and post-procedural workflow optimization are described. The control measures described may increase the cost of the equipment, prolong procedural times and increase technical difficulties. However, these precautions may help control the spread of COVID-19 within the healthcare facility."
