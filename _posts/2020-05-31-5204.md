summary:
- "CT imaging is helpful for the evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Infection control inside the CT suites is also important to prevent hospital-related transmission of COVID19. We present our experience with infection control protocol in the CT Suites. CT scans are helpful to the evaluation. It causes a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. The virus spreads rapidly and globally."
