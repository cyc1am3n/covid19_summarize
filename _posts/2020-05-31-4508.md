summary:
- "the pandemic of COVID-19 is causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Older age and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization and death. In this Perspective, we discuss potential mechanisms by which diabetes modulates the host-viral interactions and host-immune responses. We hope to highlight gaps in knowledge that require further studies. The current literature on SARS-CoV-2 is a key part of the study in patients with diabetes. Diabemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, a disease caused by SARS."

- "The pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, is causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Older age and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. In this Perspective, informed by the studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV, and the current literature on SARS-CoV-2, we discuss potential mechanisms by which diabetes modulates the host-viral interactions and host-immune responses. We hope to highlight gaps in knowledge that require further studies pertinent to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes."
