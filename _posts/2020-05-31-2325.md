summary:
- "China quarantined Wuhan to contain coronavirus disease. Expected COVID-19 risk is >50% in 130 (95% CI 89-190) cities and >99% in the 4 largest metropolitan areas. We estimated the probability of transportation of the disease to 369 other cities in China before the quarantine. The risk of transport was >500% in 130 cities. China quarantines Wuhan for the first time. During quarantine, the risk is estimated to be >99%."
