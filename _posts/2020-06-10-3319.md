summary:
- "the correct management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and acute coronary syndrome is still uncertain. We describe the percutaneous treatment of an unprotected left main coronary artery in a patient who is positive for the disease. Particular attention will be dedicated to the measures adopted in the catheterization laboratory to protect the staff and to avoid further spread of the infection. Level of Difficulty: Intermediate. The correct management is still unclear."
