original:
- "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative pathogen of a new infectious disease, COVID-19, that first occurred in late December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. It has since spread globally, resulting in a WHO declared pandemic, with as yet (17/4/20) more than two million confirmed cases and about 150.000 confirmed deaths. As for every new disease, clinicians, hospitals and governments struggle to find optimal clinical and public health measures to contain its spread and burden. For this, information from scientific research is crucial and fortunately we see a rapidly accumulating output of studies."
