summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 was discovered from a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan since the end of 2019. Timely identification, isolation, and whole-genome sequencing have laid the foundation for effective control of this novel infection. The efficient management of COVID-19 requires global collaboration and an efficient share of information. Governments, academic institutions, and technology enterprises are under unprecedented cooperation in controlling this outbreak from pathogen identification to outbreak containment."

original:
- "A previously unknown beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was discovered from a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan since the end of 2019. Ever since the start of COVID-19, government administrations, academic institutions, and technology enterprises are under unprecedented cooperation in controlling this outbreak from pathogen identification, epidemic situation assessment, to outbreak containment. Timely identification, isolation, and whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have laid the foundation for effective control of this novel infection. With the increasing case numbers worldwide, more real-time information is emerging, changing our understandings to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and nonetheless refining the outbreak control responses. The efficient management of COVID-19 requires global collaboration and an efficient share of information."
