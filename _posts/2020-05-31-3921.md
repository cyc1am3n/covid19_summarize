summary:
- "2019 novel coronavirus infection has been spreading in China since December 2019. Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to 2019-nCoV due to immature immune function. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should be prepared as far as possible. During the epidemic, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available equipment and staffing."

original:
- "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been spreading in China since December 2019. Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to 2019-nCoV due to immature immune function. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should be prepared for 2019-nCoV infections as far as possible. The emergency response plan enables the efficient response capability of NICU. During the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial needs of the families and neonatal care staff."
