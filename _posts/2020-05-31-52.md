summary:
- "Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, pneumonia, respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome are frequently encountered complications. The spectrum of complications is broader and include various auto-immune disorders such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barr?? and antiphospholipid syndrome. 7 patients from 6 French and Belgian Hospitals developed a first episode of autoimmune hemolytic anemia during a Covid-19 infection."

original:
- "Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (also known as Covid-19), pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome are frequently encountered complications (Zhou et al, 2020). Although the pathophysiology underlying severe Covid-19 remains poorly understood, accumulating evidence argue for hyperinflammatory syndrome causing fulminant and fatal cytokines release associated with disease severity and poor outcome (Mehta et al, 2020). However, the spectrum of complications is broader and include among others various auto-immune disorders such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barr?? and antiphospholipid syndrome (Zhang et al, 2020; Zulfiqar et al, 2020; Toscano et al, 2020). In this report we describe 7 patients from 6 French and Belgian Hospitals who developed a first episode of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) during a Covid-19 infection."
