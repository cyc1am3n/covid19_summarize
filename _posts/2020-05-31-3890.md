summary:
- "deaths in three brothers in Iran suggest genetic predisposition to COVID-19 in some individuals. We report fatal cases of novel coronavirus disease in Iran. An increased susceptibility to specific pathogens has been reported for a number of genetic defects. Most of the brothers who are affected by the disease recover. Deaths in the three brothers with no known underlying disease suggest a genetic predicament to the disease."

original:
- "We report fatal cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in three brothers in Iran. An increased susceptibility to specific pathogens has been reported for a number of genetic defects. Considering the fact that most of them who are affected by COVID-19 recover, deaths in three brothers who lived separately and had no known underlying disease suggest genetic predisposition to COVID-19 in some individuals."
