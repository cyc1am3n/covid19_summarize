summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly to other provinces in China and dozens of countries and regions around the world. Tumor patients are at high risk of this pathogen because of their impaired immune function. This paper reviews the clinical characteristics of neoplastic patients with COVID-19. Identifying tumor patients with the disease early can improve the cure rate of patients."

original:
- "Since mid-December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has outbroken in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly to other provinces in China and dozens of countries and regions around the world, becoming the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Public Health Emergency of International Concern). SARS-CoV-2 can mainly transmit by droplets or close contact, and is generally susceptible in the crowd. Tumor patients are at high risk of this pathogen because of their impaired immune function. Identifying tumor patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) early, and understanding its distribution characteristics can help to improve the cure rate of patients, and better control the epidemic and development of SARS-CoV-2 much better. With comprehensive analysis of relevant literature, this paper reviews the clinical characteristics of neoplastic patients with COVID-19, and puts forward some suggestions on how to deal with this epidemic."
