summary:
- "the shortage has led to a sharp crunch in hand sanitizers at all levels. The shortage has lead to an increase in the prevalence of falsified alcohol-based products. Regulatory and public health bodies should take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol. These findings indicate that regulators should take a role in protecting the safety of anti-microbs products at every stage of the product's lifecycle, including distribution, manufacture and import. This is the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19 in the global demand and consumption."

original:
- "With the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19 throughout the world, the demand and consumption of hand sanitizers has increased, which had led to a sharp crunch in these products at all levels. This shortage has led to an increase in the prevalence of falsified alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including the illegal addition of methanol to hand sanitizers and the production of hand sanitizers with an alcohol concentration of less than 60%. These findings indicate that regulatory and public health bodies should take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers at every stage of the products' lifecycle, including distribution, manufacture and import."
