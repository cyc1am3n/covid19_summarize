summary:
- "the COVID-19 affects vulnerable groups disproportionally in a society where inequities are long-standing issue. Weak health system, especially the shortage and maldistribution of capable health workforce will be the main challenge in lower income countries. International collaboration with already well functioned local mechanisms is the key to provide prompt support. Applying the lesson learned and success from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is important."

original:
- "The COVID-19 affects vulnerable groups disproportionally in a society where inequities are long-standing issue. Weak health system, especially the shortage and maldistribution of capable health workforce will be the main challenge in lower income countries to fight against the COVID-19. Applying the lesson learned and success from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is important. International collaboration with already well functioned local mechanisms, such as the Network of Managers of Health Workforce in Francophone Africa is the key to provide prompt support. This approach contributes not only to the short-term COVID-19 control but also long-term strengthening of the sustainable and resilient health system in the lower income countries."
