summary:
- "WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic. The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19. Vitamin D levels are severely low in the aging population especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. It should be advisable to perform dedicated studies about vitamin D levels in COV-19 patients with different degrees of disease severity."

original:
- "WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic. The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19. The mean levels of vitamin D for 20 European countries and morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 were acquired. Negative correlations between mean levels of vitamin D (average 56??mmol/L, STDEV 10.61) in each country and the number of COVID-19 cases/1??M (mean 295.95, STDEV 298.7, and mortality/1??M (mean 5.96, STDEV 15.13) were observed. Vitamin D levels are severely low in the aging population especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. This is also the most vulnerable group of the population in relation to COVID-19. It should be advisable to perform dedicated studies about vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients with different degrees of disease severity."
