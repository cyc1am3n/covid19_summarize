title: "Hypertension is a clinically important risk factor for severe illness and mortality in COVID-19"

summary:
- "Several articles have noted that hypertension is a risk factor for COVID-19. It is currently difficult to distinguish between hypertension as an independent risk factor. The virus binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor [2-7] Hypertension is an independent and co-varies with other patient factors such as age and cardiovascular disease. Reports of hypertension suggest a consistent association with more severe disease and increased mortality."

original:
- "The virus responsible for COVID-19 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor [1]. Several articles have noted that hypertension is a risk factor for COVID-19 [2-7]. It is currently difficult to distinguish between hypertension as an independent risk factor in COVID-19 from one that co-varies with other patient factors such as age and cardiovascular disease. It is difficult from individual reports to determine whether hypertension is a risk factor for development of symptomatic disease or hospitalisation or for more severe disease. Reviewing the literature that reports rates of hypertension amongst included patients indicates a consistent association with more severe disease and increased mortality."
