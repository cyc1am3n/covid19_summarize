summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing human pandemic. There is a massive international effort underway to develop diagnostic reagents, vaccines and antiviral drugs to slow down the spread of the disease and save lives. The research community is working with plants to achieve the rapid supply of protein antigens and antibodies for diagnostic kits and scalable production systems."

original:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for an ongoing human pandemic (COVID-19). There is a massive international effort underway to develop diagnostic reagents, vaccines and antiviral drugs in a bid to slow down the spread of the disease and save lives. One part of that international effort involves the research community working with plants, bringing researchers from all over the world together with commercial enterprises in order to achieve the rapid supply of protein antigens and antibodies for diagnostic kits, and scalable production systems for the emergency manufacturing of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Here we look at some of the ways in which plants can and are being used in the fight against COVID-19."
