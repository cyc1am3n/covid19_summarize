summary:
- "up to 31 March 2020, 105,792 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Italy. It is important to forecast the evolution of the situation and the possible effects if this lock down would continue for another two months. Results Predictions were done with 93.75% accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of positive cases might reach the value of 182,757. 81,635 at end of May if the lock down is continuous. This is the 9 March 2020 lockdown in Italy has been confirmed in the country including 15,726 cases confirmed."

original:
- "Up to 31 March 2020, 105,792 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Italy including 15,726 deaths which explains how worst the epidemic has affected the country. After announcing lockdown in Italy on the 9 March 2020, situation is becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the evolution of the Italy situation and the possible effects if this lock down would continue for another two months. Methods Patient statistics were extracted from Italian Health Ministry website where the COVID-19 outbreak of reproductive cases and recovered cases based on last 45 days are reported. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA encompasses the forecast package in R to predict. Results Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of positive cases might reach the value of 182,757 and forecasting of recovered cases might reach the value of 81,635 at end of May if the lock down is continuous. Conclusions This study highlights the necessity of country lock down and self isolation to control disease transmissibility among Italian population through data driven model analysis. Our findings suggest that nearly 35% of decay in positive cases and 66% of growth in recovered cases could be possible."
