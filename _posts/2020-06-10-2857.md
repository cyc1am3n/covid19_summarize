summary:
- "human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019. Hydroxychloroquine showed an antiviral effect in vitro. In vivo it showed efficacy, especially when combined with azithromycin in a preliminary clinical trial. The combination of hydroxychloroquin and azithropine has a synergistic effect on SARS. repurposing represents a short-term strategy to treat millions of infected patients at low morbidity and mortality caused a pandemic with SARS CoV-2."

original:
- "Human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019 and led to a pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. As there are currently no effective drugs targeting this virus, drug repurposing represents a short-term strategy to treat millions of infected patients at low costs. Hydroxychloroquine showed an antiviral effect in vitro. In vivo it showed efficacy, especially when combined with azithromycin in a preliminary clinical trial. Here we demonstrate that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung."
