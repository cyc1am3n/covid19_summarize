summary:
- "in December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus began in Wuhan, China. We report the epidemiological and clinical features of the first patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia imported into Korea from Wuhan. The report suggests that chest radiography would miss patients with pneumonia. This report highlights taking travel history is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of 2019-NCoV cases. In the early phase of the outbreak, chest radiographie would miss patient with pneumonia, he says. A viral infection caused by the 2019 novel corona virus began in China began in the outbreak."
