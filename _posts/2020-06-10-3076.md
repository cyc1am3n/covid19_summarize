summary:
- "A 57-year-old man was diagnosed with acute aortic dissection (AAD) He marked infiltration shadows in his right lung. Intraoperative findings showed that large subadventitial hematomas had spread from the ascending to the right pulmonary artery. AAD must be considered in rare cases of AAD with pulmonary infiltration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
