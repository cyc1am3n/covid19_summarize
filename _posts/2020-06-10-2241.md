summary:
- "Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opazities."

original:
- "In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings. Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent. Follow-up imaging in a subset of patients during the study time window often demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities."
