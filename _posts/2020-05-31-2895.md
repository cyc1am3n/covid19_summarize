summary:
- "the global coronavirus crisis may redefine our relationship to the natural world. In times of apocalyptic news from many countries affected by COVID-19, news stories of conservation successes, receding pollution and wild animals exploring deserted cities appear as silver linings. The widely shared experience of vulnerability may even shock humanity into addressing those other global risks that were never taken seriously enough, including climate change and antibiotics resistance. Michael Gross reports."
