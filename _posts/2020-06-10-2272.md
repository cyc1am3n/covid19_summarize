summary:
- "otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for surgery. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely. Clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. The Coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic is a global health crisis. No uniform best practice recommendations for otrolaryngology patients at increased risk of developing."

original:
- "The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis and otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. RESULTS: Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs. CONCLUSION: We summarize current best-practice recommendations for otolaryngologists to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients."
