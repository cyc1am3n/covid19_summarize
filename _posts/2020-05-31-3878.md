summary:
- "the prevention and control period will have varying degrees of impact on the implementation of clinical trials. Several examinations in ophthalmological clinical trials need close contact between operators and patients, which put us at risk of cross-infection. This paper indicated suggestions based on the criteria of trials under major public health emergencies. It may be helpful to the op-clinical trials researchers and subjects during the period of novel coronavirus pneumonia. Some suggestions may be useful to the clinical trials researchers."
