summary:
- "A total of 137 genomes of coronavirus strains from elsewhere were analysed. To investigate the evolutionary history of the current pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. We performed phylogenetic analysis, structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. The SARS-CoV2 was more similar to the bats' betacorona virus isolates. YAK/HY24/CH/2017 was the closest match in the comparison of the structural models."

original:
- "To investigate the evolutionary history of the current pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), a total of 137 genomes of coronavirus strains from elsewhere with release dates between January 2019 and 25 March 2020 were analysed. To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV2, we have analysed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasize on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis, structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that the SARS-CoV2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 as the closest match in the comparison of the spike glycoproteins structural models. Interestingly, a set of unique features described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus. Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS-CoV2, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, could also come from the yak as an intermediate host.
