original:
- "Coronavirus (COVID-19) endemic is growing exponentially in the whole world. Researchers, technologists, doctors and other healthcare workers are working day and night on the development of vaccine and medicinesto control and treat this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries. As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future. We have identified some opportunities for academic research related to COVID-19 and have also provided suggestions to contain, prevent and treat this viral infection."
