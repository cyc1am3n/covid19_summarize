original:
- "The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, placing unprecedented strain on the healthcare system. Healthcare resources including hospital beds, ICUs, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) are becoming increasingly rationed and scare commodities. In this environment, the laryngectomee (patient having previously undergone a total laryngectomy) continues to represent a unique patient with unique needs. Given their surgically altered airway, they pose a challenge to manage for the otolaryngologist within the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this brief report, we present special considerations and best practice recommendations in the management of total laryngectomy patients. We also discuss recommendations for laryngectomy patients and minimizing community exposures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
