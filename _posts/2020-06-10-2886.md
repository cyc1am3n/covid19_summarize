original:
- "Last week, Congress gave $8 billion to the fight against coronavirus, seemingly overnight. Certainly, compared to the extra $2 billion a year for addressing the opioid epidemic, the money came much faster. It took years for the State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (STR) grant to be included, as it was in the Cures Act passed by Congress in 2016 and signed into law by President Obama in December of that year. The State Opioid Response (SOR) grants continue. How did the coronavirus $8 billion ? $6 billion more than the White House had asked for ? materialize so quickly? We asked two Capitol Hill experts."
