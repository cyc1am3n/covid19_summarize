summary:
- "French recommendations have been proposed for psychotropics use and adaptations during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. We propose here elements allowing to base the pharmacotherapeutic decisions potentially useful in Covid+ patients with psychiatric disorders. There are uncertainties linked to the lack of data and speculation about possible adaptations. The recommendations are aimed at reducing the effects of the coronavirus. French recommendations are being proposed for the use of the drugs."
