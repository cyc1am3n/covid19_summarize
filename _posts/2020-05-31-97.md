summary:
- "the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remain enigmatic. Mutations tending to deplete the genome in its cytosine content will progressively lead to attenuation. This is counteracted by recombination when different mutants co-infect the same host. Monitoring as a function of time the genome sequences in closely related cases is critical to anticipate the future of the virus and hence of COVID-19."

original:
- "The origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains enigmatic. It is likely to be a continuum resulting from inevitable mutations and recombination events. These genetic changes keep developing in the present epidemic. Mutations tending to deplete the genome in its cytosine content will progressively lead to attenuation as a consequence of Muller's ratchet, but this is counteracted by recombination when different mutants co-infect the same host, in particular in clusters of infection. Monitoring as a function of time the genome sequences in closely related cases is critical to anticipate the future of SARS-CoV-2 and hence of COVID-19."
