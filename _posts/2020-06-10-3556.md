- "Among the other benefits of the CARES Act ? the $2 trillion law signed by President Trump March 27 ?is a big boost to telemedicine, including telepsychiatry. For so many years, psychiatrists have been hampered by the fact that, in general, they can't get paid for telemedicine. Insurance won't cover it, and, for the most part, patients assume that a phone call ? or an email or text ? should be free."
