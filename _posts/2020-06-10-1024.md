summary:
- "cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a marked threat to human and animal health (1). Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2-10. The outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic."

original:
- "Cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a marked threat to human and animal health (1) . Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2-10) . Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth."
