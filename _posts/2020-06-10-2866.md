summary:
- "Using narratives can enhance effective climate science communication. We explore how social scientific approaches can help to better tailor climate science messaging to this varied landscape. This Primer discusses the heterogeneous manner in which climate change messaging is received by different audiences. The use of narratives is essential for enhancing salience, understanding, and engagement and accelerating action. It is important to consider the emotional and affective dimensions of climate messaging."

original:
- "Approaches to communicating climate science beyond academia are necessary for enhancing salience, understanding, and engagement and accelerating action. This Primer discusses the heterogeneous manner in which climate change messaging is received by different audiences, how social scientific approaches could help to better tailor climate change messaging to this varied landscape, and how attempts to close this gap must consider the emotional and affective dimensions of climate messaging. We explore how the use of narratives can enhance effective climate science communication and emphasize the importance of evidence-based advocacy in the current era of global challenges, uncertainty, and post-truth."
