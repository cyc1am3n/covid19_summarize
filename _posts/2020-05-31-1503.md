The most common disease was acne, only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment. Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital.

original:
- "Coronavirus disease, first emerged in Wuhan, rapidly spread all over the World since December 2019. There are concerns about elective dermatology appointments and its results. Herein, we aimed to find out which type of dermatologic patients attended to dermatology outpatient clinic. The patients visiting the clinics for elective dermatologic diseases between 11 and March 18, 2020 were included in this study. Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained. There were 390 patients attending to the dermatology outpatient clinic in this period. The most common disease was acne (N:94, 24%), only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment. There were 40 (10%) patients over the age of 65. After their visits, 5 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 in two weeks. Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission since being closed to the patient. Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital. Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of the our patients weren't screened for COVID-19. Our findings support the concerns of elective physician examinations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
