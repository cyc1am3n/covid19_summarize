The pandemic of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached 185 Countries with an increasing number of deaths.

By respecting the entire set of universal precautions and recommendations the highlighted risks can be minimized, and best practice in human identification should always be a priority for human rights of the dead.
