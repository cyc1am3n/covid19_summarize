summary:
- "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID 19) pandemic has placed an unprecedented challenge on health care systems across the globe. Rapid assessment of the cardiorespiratory function to monitor disease progression and guide treatment is essential. We have designed the COVID-US: a simplified cardiopulmonary ultrasound approach to use in suspected and confirmed patients. This is to aid front-line health workers in their decision-making in a surge crisis."
