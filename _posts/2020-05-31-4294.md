summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has revealed the global importance of robust diagnostic testing. It remains uncertain whether there may have been community circulation of SARS-coV-2 prior to the identification of individuals with positive results through standard public health surveillance. Sample pooling, a strategy used for community monitoring of other infectious diseases such as trachoma, has not been deployed for the early comprehensive screening of the disease in the United States. There is a limited testing capacity available in the U.S. was not tested despite COVID-19) pandema, but without travel or exposure history."

original:
- "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed the global importance of robust diagnostic testing to differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from other routine respiratory infections and guide appropriate clinical management. Given the limited testing capacity available in the United States early in the pandemic, individuals with a clinical syndrome consistent with COVID-19, but without travel or exposure history, were not tested. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether there may have been community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the identification of individuals with positive results through standard public health surveillance. Sample pooling, a strategy used for community monitoring of other infectious diseases such as trachoma, has not, to our knowledge, been deployed for the early comprehensive screening of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States."
