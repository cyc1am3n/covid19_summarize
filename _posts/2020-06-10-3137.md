summary:
- "Increasing evidence obtained from completed clinical studies indicates the prospects for chloroquine to treat COVID-19. More randomized control clinical studies are warranted to determine the feasibility of these two drugs. The drugs are specifically efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. CoV-2 has a potential to treat coronavirus disease 2019. Drugs that are specifically effective against CoVID-2 have yet to be established."

- "Drugs that are specifically efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be established. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have garnered considerable attention for their potential to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Increasing evidence obtained from completed clinical studies indicates the prospects for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. More randomized control clinical studies are warranted to determine the feasibility of these two drugs in treating COVID-19."
