original:
- "The recent outbreak of Covid19 has required urgent treatments for numerous patients. No suitable vaccines or antivirals are available for Covid19. The efficiency against Covid19 of WHO therapies of choice, that are two antivirals developed for other pathologies, is controversial. Therefore, alternative approaches are required. Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C (Vit-C) has emerged as one of the other alternatives for this purpose. Here we review the effects of IV Vit-C on the immune system response, the antiviral properties of IV Vit-C, and finally the antioxidant properties of IV Vit-C to specifically address the cytokines' storm characteristic of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that occur in the later cycle of the Covid19 infectious disease."
