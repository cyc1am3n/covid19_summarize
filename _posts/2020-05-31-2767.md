summary:
- "the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 creates another health burden for people living with HIV. The burdens can affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of PLWH. They can interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to HIV treatment. These burdens are a syndemic framework that can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of the disease. We need to address these morbidities and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes, we say."

original:
- "The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 creates another health burden for people living with HIV (PLWH) who face multiple morbidities and may be at heightened risk for severe physical health illness from COVID-19. Our abilities to address these morbidities in PLWH must be considered alongside the socially-produced burdens that both place this population at risk for COVID-19 and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes. These burdens can affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of PLWH and interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to HIV treatment. We posit that a syndemic framework can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of COVID-19 among PLWH to inform the development of health programming services."
