summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. There is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of the virus circulating in Italy from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the introduction and establishment of the novel beta Coronavirus. Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of current epidemics, which might help attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.

original:
- "The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has raised serious concerns due to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analysed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of the currently SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.
