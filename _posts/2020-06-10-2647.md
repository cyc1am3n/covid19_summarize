- "COVID-19 is now accepted as a pandemic. It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased. This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients. He says there was a significant relationship between the incidence and mortality. There is a link between lymph openia and mortality, he says. The issue is how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause the disease."

original:
- "As we know more about the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, which is now accepted as a pandemic, many questions have been raised about how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients. It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased in COVID-19 and there was a significant relationship between lymphopenia and mortality. This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia. This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia."
