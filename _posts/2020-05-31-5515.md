summary:
- "During major epidemic outbreaks, demand for health care workers grows even as the extreme pressures they face cause declining availability. Taiwan's SARS experience argue that a modified form of Traffic Control Bundling protects health care worker safety and by extension strengthens overall COVID-19 epidemic control. We draw on Taiwanese SARS experiences to argue that an improved form of traffic control Bundle protects safety of workers."
