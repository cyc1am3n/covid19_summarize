summary:
- "airborne-infection isolation rooms are needed in centers that treat COVID-19 patients. Wards and rooms must be carefully checked to ensure an ample supply of medical air and oxygen. Anterooms adjacent to AIIRS are required to maintain pressure differentials and provide an area for donning/doffing or disinfecting medical equipment. AIIRs are needed to provide area for disinfecting or donning medical equipment and donning. Rooms must be monitored to ensure adequate supply of oxygen and air."

original:
- "More airborne-infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) are needed in centers that treat severely affected COVID-19 patients. Wards and rooms must be carefully checked to ensure an ample supply of medical air and oxygen. Anterooms adjacent to AIIRS are required to maintain pressure differentials and provide an area for donning/doffing or disinfecting medical equipment."
