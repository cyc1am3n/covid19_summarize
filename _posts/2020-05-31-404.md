summary:
- "the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented challenge to the society. Clinicians across the nation's rehabilitation system have already begun working to initiate intensive care unit-based rehabilitation care. The complications can be reduced by delivering interdisciplinary rehabilitation that is initiated early and continued throughout the acute hospital stay. Rehabilitation professionals can play an important role in the recovery process for individuals with the disease."

original:
- "The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented challenge to the society. Currently, the United States stands as the most affected country, and the entire healthcare system is affected, from emergency department, intensive care unit, post-acute care, outpatient, to home care. Considering the debility, neurological, pulmonary, neuromuscular and cognitive complications, rehabilitation professionals can play an important role in the recovery process for individuals with COVID-19. Clinicians across the nation's rehabilitation system have already begun working to initiate intensive care unit-based rehabilitation care and develop programs, settings and specialized care to meet the short- and long-term needs of these individuals. We describe the anticipated rehabilitation demands, and the strategies to meet the needs of this population. The complications from COVID-19 can be reduced by (1) delivering interdisciplinary rehabilitation that is initiated early and continued throughout the acute hospital stay, (2) providing patient/family education for self-care after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation at either acute or subacute settings, and (3) continuing rehabilitation care in the outpatient setting, and at home through ongoing therapy either in-person or via telehealth."
