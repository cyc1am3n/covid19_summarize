summary:
- "tracheostomy should be a rare event yet one that requires significant decision making and procedural deliberation. Indications for surgery must be balanced by risk of disease transmission to health care workers. Considerations are given to personal protective equipment, viral testing, and alternatives. Otolaryngologists worldwide must be aware of these considerations to provide safe patient care without undue risk to themselves or their hospital coworkers. The global COVID-19 pandemic should be an event that requires substantial decision-making, care, and technical performance in patients with coronavirus disease."
