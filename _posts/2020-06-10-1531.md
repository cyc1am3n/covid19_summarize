original:
- "The coronavirus pandemic is a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. For urology, the expansion of the health-care structures for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 should be supported as best as possible. At the same time, one should aim to ensure adequate care for urological emergencies and urgent urological treatments as far as possible, even during the pandemic. For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used. Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment. Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV2-positive patients. Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV2 patients should be considered. Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up."
