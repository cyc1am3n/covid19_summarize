summary:
- "coronavirus pneumonia has created challenges in the management of elderly hip fracture patients. Hip fractures account for more than half of osteoporotic fractures and represent a substantial economic and social burden. During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture. No cross-infection occurred. Our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel."

original:
- "Hip fractures in the elderly account for more than half of osteoporotic fractures and represent a substantial economic and social burden. Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which began to spread in December 2019, has created challenges in the management of elderly hip fracture patients, not only by influencing the choice of operation and postoperative rehabilitation methods, but also by generating new risks for the medical staff. During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit in the center of the epidemic area effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture, and no cross-infection occurred. Therefore, our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel."
