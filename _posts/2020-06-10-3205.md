original:
- "As a practicing front line clinician in the acute adult general medical field, I read Dr Stein's recent insightful article on novel coronavirus (COVID 19)(1) with great interest. News reports in the UK and around the world carry daily updates and increasing speculation about the potential global impact as the virus spreads much as Dr Stein predicted. However, a number of questions appear to be emerging that were not covered when Dr Stein published his editorial in IJCP."
