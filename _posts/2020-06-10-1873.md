On March 6th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 6,284, with 42 dead. This study, through collecting epidemiological data about various COVID-19 infection cases, discovered that getting together in large groups leads to massive infection, and that paying close attention to personal hygiene via wearing masks, sanitary gloves, etc. can prevent the spread of COVID-19.
