summary:
- "Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA. Results indicate a trend toward reduced detection in respiratory drops. The results indicate that surgical faces could prevent transmission of human coronanaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. Our results indicate surgical face mask could prevent the transmission of influenza viruses and flu viruses. We identified seasonal humans in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness. Surgical faces masks could reduce the detection of seasonal human RNA, influenza virus and influenza virus in aerosols."

Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals."
