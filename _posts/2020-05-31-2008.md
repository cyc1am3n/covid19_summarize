summary:
- "many anesthesiology learners are assigned to stay at home. We report on a novel use of existing resources to structure a daily nationwide learning experience. Kotter's change management model (KCMM) drives the process. The COVID-19 crisis has cancelled all elective procedures. Many learners are unable to learn in the clinical environment. Our report on the use of new resources."
