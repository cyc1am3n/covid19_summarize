summary:
- "the aim of this manuscript is to provide a standard of care of non-emergency medicine trained physicians who are not customary with mechanical ventilation. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate the best practice recommendations regarding the mechanical ventilation of patients with ARDS. This focus is particularly addressed to physicians who were not experienced in the invasive respiratory management of patients. It remains fundamental to acknowledge that new insights concerning this rapidly spreading illness become available on regular basis."

This focus is particularly addressed to physicians who are not experienced in the invasive respiratory management of ARDS patients. Nevertheless, it remains fundamental to acknowledge that new insights concerning this quickly spreading illness become available on a regular base."
