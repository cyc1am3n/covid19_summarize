summary:
- "the aim of this document is to provide general guidance and specific recommendations on the practice of cardiovascular magnetic resonance. There are two major considerations: continued urgent and semi-urgent care for the patients with no known active COVID-19 should be provided in a safe manner for both patients and staff. CMR should focus on the specific clinical question with an emphasis on myocardial function and tissue characterization while optimizing patient and staff safety."

There are two major considerations. First, continued urgent and semi-urgent care for the patients who have no known active COVID-19 should be provided in a safe manner for both patients and staff. Second, when necessary, CMR on patients with confirmed or suspected active COVID-19 should focus on the specific clinical question with an emphasis on myocardial function and tissue characterization while optimizing patient and staff safety."
