summary:
- "sharing data for COVID-19 applications will help connect scientists across the global biomolecular simulation community. Sharing of data will improve connection and communication between simulation and experimental and clinical data and investigators. We commit to the following principles and offer our support to others already working on open data efforts. Shared data will help improve connection between simulation, experimental, clinical data, investigators, and experimental data."

original:
- "There is an urgent need to share our methods, models, and results openly and quickly to test findings, ensure reproducibility, test significance, eliminate dead-ends, and accelerate discovery. Sharing of data for COVID-19 applications will help connect scientists across the global biomolecular simulation community, and also improve connection and communication between simulation and experimental and clinical data and investigators. We, as a community, commit to the following principles and offer our support to others already working on open data efforts in the hope that others working on COVID-19 in biomolecular simulation and other areas will adopt similar best practices."
