summary:
- "appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and public health surveillance. Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in cases affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Inferences are based on a new infectious disease in the future. Identifying cases over time can be important for public health monitoring. Case definitions can be tracked over time. It is important for diagnosis and monitoring if new infectious diseases emerge. Measures are crucial to establish rapid spread and effectiveness of intervention."
