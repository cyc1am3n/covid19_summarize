summary:
- "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental health condition caused by a terrifying event outside the normal range of usual human experience. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis. SARS in 2003 was very traumatizing for population, with a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms."

original:
- "Since December 8th 2019 and the onset of the first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China, the disease rapidly spread around the world, with hundred-thousand cases and thousands of deaths (Dutheil et al., 2020). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental health condition caused by a terrifying event outside the normal range of usual human experience (Belrose et al., 2018). Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past (Xu et al., 2011; C??nat et al., 2020). Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza (Morens et al., 2020), the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to also promote PTSD. Moreover, the COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of related coronaviruses (Jiang et al., 2020). The SARS in 2003 was very traumatizing for population, with a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms (Koralek et al., 2015; Wendlandt et al., 2018). The evocation of SARS is thus generating a great anxiety and biased responses to threat, which can both promote PTSD (Bo et al., 2020; Mekawi et al., 2020). D"
