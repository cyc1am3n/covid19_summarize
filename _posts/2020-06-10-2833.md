summary:
- "CD3+T, CD4+T and CD8+T cells were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients. T cell subset counts were related to severity and prognosis of disease. CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in patients with significantly elevated CD4-CD8. NK cells were also significantly decreased. The counts can be used as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease severity. This study evaluated the significance of lymphocyte subsets detection in peripheral blood in the diagnosis and."

original:
- "This study evaluated the significance of lymphocyte subsets detection in peripheral blood in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results revealed that CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a relatively slight decrease in CD4+T cells but a severe decrease of CD8+T cells. The significantly elevated CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in COVID-19 patients. T cell subset counts were related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. The counts of CD8+T and CD4+T cells can be used as diagnostic markers of COVID-19 and predictors of disease severity."
