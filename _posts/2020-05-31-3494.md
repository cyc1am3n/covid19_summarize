summary:
- "the first reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome. The scientific community working in the field of type III IFNs (IFN-??) realized that this class could play an important role in this and other emerging viral infections. In this Viewpoint, we present our opinion on the benefits and potential limitations of using IFN-?? to prevent, limit, and treat these dangerous viral infections. This Viewpoint presents our viewpoint."
