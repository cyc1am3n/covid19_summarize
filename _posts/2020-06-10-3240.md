title: "Angiotensin receptor blockers and COVID-19"

summary:
- "ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine if ARB may be included as additional therapy for COVD-19 patients. Angiotensin Receptor Blockers exhibit major pleiotropic protection effects beyond their antihypertensive properties, including those from severe respiratory syndrome."

original:
- "Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) exhibit major pleiotropic protecting effects beyond their antihypertensive properties, including reduction of inflammation. ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections, including those from coronavirus. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. For these reasons ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for COVID-19 patients."
