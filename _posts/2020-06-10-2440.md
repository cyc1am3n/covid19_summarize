original:
- "The Seattle, Washington area was ground zero for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Its initial emergence in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) not only highlighted the vulnerability of its patients and residents, but also the limited clinical support that led to national headlines. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic heightened the need for improved collaboration among healthcare organizations and local and state public health. The University of Washington Medicine's Post-Acute Care Network developed a three phase approach, Initial, Delayed and Surge Phases, to help slow the spread of the disease, support local area SNFs from becoming overwhelmed when inundated with COVID-19 cases or persons under investigation, and help decrease the burden on area hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services.
