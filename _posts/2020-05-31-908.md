summary:
- "the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a main role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and liquid balance. Previous evidence suggests that RAS may represent an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies. The scientific community has recently focused its attention on ACE inhibitors and a potential benefit/harms for patients infected by Coronavirus disease who experience pneumonia. There are still some doubts about the effects of these drugs in this setting."

original:
- "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a main role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and liquid balance. Previous evidence suggests that RAS may represent an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies, especially for acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic fibrotic disease. The scientific community has recently focused its attention on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) inhibitors and their possible benefit/harms for patients infected by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who experience pneumonia, but there are still some doubts about the effects of these drugs in this setting."
