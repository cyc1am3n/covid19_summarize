summary:
- "Vac1 and Vac2 of DPI 2 in Figure 7C were misplaced. We resected the paraffin-embedded lung tissue blocks and stained them with the same antibody. The blue lines should be the results of mAb219-10-28 + HBV peptide in Figure 4B,C. They were incorrectly labeled as hW49 + S597-625, respectively."

original:
- "Two pathological pictures of Vac1 and Vac2 of DPI 2 in Figure 7C were unfortunately misplaced (left, top two pictures). Due to color fading of the positive cells in the original pathological section, we resected the paraffin-embedded lung tissue blocks and stained them with the same antibody. The wrong ones were replaced in this corrected Figure 7C. In addition, the blue lines should be the results of mAb219-10-28 + HBV peptide and hW49 + HBV peptide in Figure 4B,C; they were incorrectly labeled as mAb219-10-28 + S597-625 and hW49 + S597-625, respectively."
