original:
- "This note provides an early assessment of the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for food supply chains and for supply chain resilience. The effect of demand-side shocks on food supply chains are discussed, including consumer panic buying behaviours with respect to key items, and the sudden change in consumption patterns away from the food service sector to meals prepared and consumed at home. Potential supply-side disruptions to food supply chains are assessed including labour shortages, disruptions to transportation networks, and ?thickening? of the Canada-U.S. border with respect to the movement of goods. Finally, the note considers whether the Covid-19 pandemic will have longer-lasting effects on the nature of food supply chains, including the growth of the online grocery delivery sector, and the extent to which consumers will prioritize ?local? food supply chains.
