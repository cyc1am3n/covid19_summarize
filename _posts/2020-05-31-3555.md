summary:
- "outbreak of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase - chain - reaction (RT - PCR) method can be used for the detection of the live virus in oral swabs(1). Now, results have confirmed the presence of the virus in stool samples from patients with COVID- 19(2). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
