summary:
- "we are proposing to use machine learning algorithms to improve case identifications of COVID-19. This will also reduce the spread in the susceptible populations. We are using a mobile phone-based web survey to improve cases identifications. The algorithms will also be able to improve the spread. It will reduce spread in susceptible populations and reduce spread of the disease. A mobile phone survey will be used to find out if we can use the algorithms."
