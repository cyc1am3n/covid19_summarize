summary:
- "traditional control measures from an infectious disease include personal hygiene, vaccination, vector control, environmental controls, prophylaxis and quarantine. Vaccincinia virus eradicated smallpox, bed nets control malaria and condoms reduce HIV transmission. Widespread use of personal respirators has not been possible to date due to complexity and limited supply."

original:
- "Traditional control measures from an infectious disease include personal hygiene, vaccination, vector control, environmental controls, prophylaxis and quarantine. For example, vaccinia virus eradicated smallpox, bed nets control malaria and condoms reduce HIV transmission. As SARS-CoV-2 transmits to the face or mouth, an alternative would be to protect these areas, which can be achieved by a personal respirator. Widespread use of personal respirators has not been possible to date due to their complexity and limited supply. We have developed a simple personal respirator in Southampton (PeRSo), made from cheap, mass-produced components7, 8. The motor unit fan pulls air through a high efficiency filter, powered by rechargeable batteries. The clear air is delivered into a hood with a clear plastic visor and passes standard sniff and bacterial tests (Figure 1). We have initiated manufacture locally and are aiming to roll out widely in the United Kingdom, and are investigating components suitable for local production in the developing world (PeRSo-DW)."
