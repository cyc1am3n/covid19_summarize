summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has created feelings of fear, grief and helplessness for people around the world. Facing uncertainty, surrounded by death and suffering has led many health professionals to experience moral distress. This distress has also been fueled by concerns about health care rationing based on factors such as age. Fears that health care systems have not been prepared for the pandemic and that patients and health care professionals have been put at an unnecessary risk."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has likely changed the worldview of healthcare - at least for a generation. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has generated feelings of fear, grief and helplessness for people around the world and for many health professionals these emotions are particularly accentuated. Facing uncertainty, surrounded by death and suffering has led many health professionals to experience moral distress, particularly because of the feeling of being unable to meet the needs of patients and colleagues. This distress has also been fueled by concerns about health care rationing based on factors such as age, and feelings that health care systems have not been prepared for the pandemic and that patients and health care professionals have been put at an unnecessary risk."
