summary:
- "OBJECTIVE: Analyze a set of indicators to understand the variability of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in selected countries. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. Incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables and a relative fatality index has been created. Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic."

original:
- "OBJECTIVE: Analyze a set of indicators to understand the variability of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in a set of selected countries. METHOD: Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables. In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. RESULTS: Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. CONCLUSION: Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary."
