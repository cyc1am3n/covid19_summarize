summary:
- "negative results of RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 were not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient. We report the dynamic change process of target genes. The diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. In this case, negative results were excluded from negative results. Negative results should be taken into account for absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS Cov-2."

original:
- "We report the dynamic change process of target genes by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 during the course of a COVID-19 patient: from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2, and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed COVID-19."
