summary:
- "ACEIs/ARBs are the most widely used drugs for cardiovascular diseases. The clinical effect of COVID-19 is still uncertain. This paper describes their potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. It may provide useful in the advice of cardiologists and physicians. Many cases were elderly, and many had at least one chronic disease, especially cardiovascular diseases, a study found. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are most widely. used drugs. Clinical effect is still unknown."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which initially began in China, has spread to other countries of Asia, Europe, America, Africa and Oceania, with the number of confirmed cases and suspected cases increasing each day. According to recently published research, it was found that the majority of the severe cases were elderly, and many of them had at least one chronic disease, especially cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) are the most widely used drugs for cardiovascular diseases. The clinical effect of ACEIs/ARBs on patients with COVID-19 is still uncertain. This paper describes their potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which may provide useful in the advice of cardiologists and physicians."
