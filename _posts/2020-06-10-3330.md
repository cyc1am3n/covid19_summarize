summary:
- "Boltzmann function-based analyses reveal potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in China, Hubei Province, outside Hubei, Wuhan City and outside Wuhan. Figures show potential total numbers of deaths in Hubei and Wuhan Province. BoltZmann analysis reveals potential number of deaths. The outbreak is on-going in China."

original:
- "The COVID-19 outbreak is on-going in China. Here Boltzmann function-based analyses reveal the potential total numbers of COVID-19 deaths in China, Hubei Province, outside Hubei, Wuhan City and outside Wuhan, being 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 (109, 112), 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 (607, 632), respectively."
