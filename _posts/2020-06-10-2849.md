Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 3?30% of patients with COVID-19 (1,2), because of direct virus-induced cytopathic effects in the respiratory tract or cytokine storms triggered by the host?s immune response. Comorbidities are known to increase the risk of ARDS in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1)."
