summary:
- "this Journal Article discusses the importance of modelling in understanding Covid-19 spread in the UK and worldwide. It highlights different modelling approaches and suggests no one model can give all the answers. Modeling is important, but no one can give the answers, he says. This Journal article discusses how modelling is important in understanding the spread of COVID-19 spread. The article highlights different approaches to limiting its' spread in Europe and the UK. Several non-pharmaceutical interventions have been at the forefront of shaping the decision to publish a Journal article on the role of modelling. Since COvid-19 transmission."

- "Since COVID-19 transmission started in late January, mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of shaping the decisions around different non-pharmaceutical interventions to confine its' spread in the UK and worldwide. This Journal Article discusses the importance of modelling in understanding Covid-19 spread, highlights different modelling approaches and suggests that while modelling is important, no one model can give all the answers."
