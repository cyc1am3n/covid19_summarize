summary:
- "Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Human rhinovirus was the most frequently detected agent. No children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The infection was not circulating in Rome before COVID-19 outbreak. We described viral aetiologies, with particular interest in detecting SARS. SARS is rare in children and it was not in Rome in Rome. Virus is rare, but not in Roma before outbreak of COV-19. It is a cause of mortality in hospitalized pneumonia in children, we described."
