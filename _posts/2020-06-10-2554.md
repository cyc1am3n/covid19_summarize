summary:
- "transmission of the virus is significantly decreased by appropriate social distancing. Fast-tracking the implementation of video consultation to replace physical appointments with virtual care is a strategy that should not be overlooked1. Provision of healthcare can be preserved for infected individuals and non-infected people scheduled for appointments not related to COVID-19. A feeling of safety for both healthcare providers and patients can be provided to reduce the psychosocial effects of fear and anxiety."

original:
- "Since the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 and the associated disease, COVID-19, in December of 2019, the effects of the virus have manifested globally. Transmission of the virus is significantly decreased by appropriate social distancing. Fast-tracking the implementation of video consultation to replace physical appointments with virtual care is a strategy that should not be overlooked1. The use of real-time video connections maintains important aspects of communication, including visual aspects, without risking physical interaction. Provision of healthcare can be preserved for infected individuals and non-infected individuals scheduled for appointments not related to COVID-19 (ref. 2). Additionally, a feeling of safety for both healthcare providers and patients can be provided to reduce the psychosocial effects of fear and anxiety."
