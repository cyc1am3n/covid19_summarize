summary:
- "the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since Dec 2019 became an emergency of major international concern. Several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of the virus. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days. This is the longest predicted incubation time for SARS, SARS and MERS."

original:
- "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since Dec 2019 in Wuhan, the major transportation hub in central China, became an emergency of major international concern. While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, highlighting the need for larger and well annotated datasets.
