summary:
- "disease prognosis has been largely influenced by multi-organ involvement. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage and shock have precipitated death. Acknowledging potential organ injuries throughout COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. This paper aims to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge."

original:
- "Since the outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 starting late December 2019, it has been apparent that disease prognosis has largely been influenced by multi-organ involvement. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on body-wide organs via ACE2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multi-organ failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. This paper aims to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19, encapsulating its multi-organ impact."
