summary:
- "computed tomographic (CT) imaging findings of 3 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia with initial negative results before CT examination. We finally confirmed positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronanavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. 3 patients were diagnosed with the disease. MRI results were computed. tomography. Results were compared to 3 patients."
