summary:
- "few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) It is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms. We present the case of a 32-day-old boy infecting by COVID19. The boy presented with an upper air way infection which resolved spontaneously and did not require therapy. In epidemic settings children should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, we argue."

original:
- "Few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms. We present the case of a 32-day-old boy infected by COVID-19 that presented with an upper air way infection which resolved spontaneously and did not require any therapy. We argue that in epidemic settings children presenting with any mild symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, and that management must be guided by clinical conditions."
