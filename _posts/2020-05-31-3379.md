summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for 1,383,436 confirmed cases of COVID-19. 378,881 cases have been confirmed in the United States. Preparation for a pandemic involves considering the different levels in the hierarchy of controls. This article provides evidence-based recommendations and measures for the appropriate personal protective equipment for different clinical and surgical activities in various settings. The most recent CDC reports estimate that there are 2.8 million trauma patients hospitalized in the U.S."

original:
- "By April 7, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for 1,383,436 confirmed cases of COVID-19, involving 209 countries around the world; 378,881 cases have been confirmed in the United States. During this pandemic, the urgent surgical requirements will not stop. As an example, the most recent CDC reports estimate that there are 2.8 million trauma patients hospitalized in the United States. These data illustrate an increase in the likelihood of encountering urgent surgical patients with either clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the near future. Preparation for a pandemic involves considering the different levels in the hierarchy of controls as well as the different phases of the pandemic. Apart from the fact that this pandemic certainly involves many important health, economic and community ramifications, it also requires several initiatives to mandate what measures are most appropriate to prepare for mitigating the occupational risks. This article provides evidence-based recommendations and measures for the appropriate personal protective equipment for different clinical and surgical activities in various settings. To reduce the occupational risk in treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 urgent orthopaedic patients, recommended precautions and preventive actions (triage area, ED consultation room, induction room, operating room, and recovery room) are reviewed."
