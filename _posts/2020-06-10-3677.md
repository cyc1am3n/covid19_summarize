summary:
- "two antimalarial agents have been trusted treatments for a range of rheumatic diseases over the past seventy years. These agents have attracted intense media attention in the past few weeks. They suggest this category of drugs may have potential in the management of coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) associated disease called COVID-19 [2], 3. The agents are believed to have potential for coronanavirus. This is the first time these drugs have been used in a number of cases of hydroxychloroquine (CQ) over the last seventies [1]."
