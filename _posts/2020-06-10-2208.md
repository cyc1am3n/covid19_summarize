summary:
- "the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 by molecular diagnostic laboratories. Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR. Low copies (25 copies/reaction) of RNA were detected. The proposed method will enable highly sensitive detection of the RNA. It will reduce reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians."

original:
- "The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 by molecular diagnostic laboratories. We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. METHODS: Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control. RESULTS: Good correlation of Cq values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies. Low copies (<25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method. CONCLUSION: The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians."
