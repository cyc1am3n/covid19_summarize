summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of severe pneumonia in humans. Viral RNA was detected in multiple organs in COVID-19 patients. The virus isolated could infect new susceptible cells and was recognized by its own patient sera. Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid transmission from urine. It was isolated from urine of a patient. A patient sera was able to isolate the virus from a virus isolated from respiratory specimens."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of severe pneumonia (COVID-19) in humans. Viral RNA was detected in multiple organs in COVID-19 patients. However, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was only isolated from respiratory specimens. Here, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from urine of a COVID-19 patient. The virus isolated could infect new susceptible cells and was recognized by its' own patient sera. Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid transmission from urine."
