summary:
- "Compared with recent viral outbreaks, COVID-19 infection has a relatively high mortality rate. We explore the contributions of the innate and adaptive immune systems to both viral control and toxicity. The novel 2019 strain of coronavirus is a source of profound morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this Perspective, we explore the contribution of the immune system to both the viral control as well as the toxicity of the virus."

original:
- "The novel 2019 strain of coronavirus is a source of profound morbidity and mortality worldwide. Compared with recent viral outbreaks, COVID-19 infection has a relatively high mortality rate, the reasons for which are not entirely clear. Furthermore, treatment options for COVID-19 infection are currently limited. In this Perspective, we explore the contributions of the innate and adaptive immune systems to both viral control as well as toxicity during COVID-19 infections and offer suggestions to both understand and therapeutically modulate anti-COVID immunity."
