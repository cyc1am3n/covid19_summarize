summary:
- "the abdominal radiologist was the first to suggest COVID-19 infection because of findings in the lung bases on CT of the abdomen. The abdomen must suggest the diagnosis when evaluating lung bases for typical findings. OBJECTIVE. Patients presented to emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain without the respiratory symptoms typical of coronavirus disease. A series of patients presented to the emergency department were presented without abdominal pain and without the symptoms typical. COVID-19 infection can present primarily with abdominal symptoms."
