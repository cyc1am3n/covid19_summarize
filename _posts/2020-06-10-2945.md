original:
- "As we write this report in April 2020, more than two million people worldwide have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and more than 150,000 have died of COVID-19 disease. International economies have been brought to a standstill, and social isolation based on palpable fear of death remains the order of the day. Appropriately or not, the United States government is talking about resuming work activities and social interaction to boost economic recovery. While this makes financial sense, from a medical perspective our population will be left defenseless in the absence of a viable treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Herein we present a plan to deal with this looming threat. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
