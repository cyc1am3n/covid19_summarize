summary:
- "Surgical Triaging Guidelines for Endocrine Surgery during COVID-19 are aligned with phases of care published by the ACS. Most cases can be safely postponed. During most acute phase, all endocrine surgeries are deferred except thyroid cancers requiring acute airway management. Guidelines provide context for individualized multidisciplinary patient care, and expectation of significant resource diversion to care."

original:
- "Background In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer care has had to adapt rapidly given the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) issuing recommendations to postpone non-urgent surgeries. Methods An institutional multidisciplinary group of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology, Surgical Endocrinology, and Medical Endocrinology devised Surgical Triaging Guidelines for Endocrine Surgery during COVID-19, aligned with phases of care published by the ACS. Results Phases of care with examples of corresponding endocrine cases are outlined. Most cases can be safely postponed with active surveillance, including most differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers. During the most acute phase, all endocrine surgeries are deferred except thyroid tumors requiring acute airway management. Conclusions These guidelines provide context for endocrine surgery within the spectrum of surgical oncology, with the goal of optimal individualized multidisciplinary patient care, and the expectation of significant resource diversion to care for COVID-19 patients.
