original:
- "Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered transmissible disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, primarily manifesting as an acute upper and lower respiratory tract illness that may be complicated by interstitial and alveolar pneumonia. It may also affect multiple other tissues such as the heart, digestive tract, kidneys, blood, and nervous system.1 The rapidly spreading outbreak, which first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of individuals affected by the disease increases by the day and there are several resources that provide up-to-date epidemiological data.2 Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its complications for several reasons. Many MHD patients are of older age and have certain comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease as well as an underlying immune-compromised state that are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.3 The logistical aspects of MHD further increase the risk of disease transmission such as recurrent physical presence at health care facilities and physical proximity of patients during hemodialysis. It is, therefore, crucial to rapidly employ appropriate preventive strategies in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. This summary is aimed at providing up-to-date scientific information about COVID-19 as it relates to MHD patients and highlighting the strategies to minimize its spread in outpatient hemodialysis facilities.[truncated]"
