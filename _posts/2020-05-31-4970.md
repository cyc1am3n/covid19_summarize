summary:
- "the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. About 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. We clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical ill COVID19 patients. Here, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and share our experience."

original:
- "The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Reports from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical ill COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients. Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system."
