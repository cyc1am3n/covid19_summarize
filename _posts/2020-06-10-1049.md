summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is mainly spread through respiratory droplets or direct contact. But the infection condition of genital system is still unknown. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computer tomography were retrospectively reviewed. Results The clinical characteristics of these ten women were similar to those reported severe COVID-19 patients."

original:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is mainly spread through respiratory droplets or direct contact. But the infection condition of genital system is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is found in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 illness. Methods 10 women with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to in Tongji Zhongfa Hospital Intensive care union(ICU) ward from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 24, 2020 were included. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computer tomography(CT)-scan examination were retrospectively reviewed. The evidence of genital infection potential was accessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluids obtained from vaginal swab samples. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaginal fluids. Results The clinical characteristics of these ten women were similar to those reported severe COVID-19 patients. All ten patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Conclusion Findings from this small group of cases suggest that no SARS-CoV-2 virus existing in the vaginal fluids of severe COVID-19 patients."
