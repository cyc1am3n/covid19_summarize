summary:
- "rapid research efforts early during the 2020 coronavirus disease pandemic are described as a global experience grew apace. The experience has lessons in purpose, structure, function, and performance of research in any emergency, when facing any threat. He says the optimal time to initiate research on emergencies is before they occur. This includes an appropriate context, clarity in scientific aims, preexisting resources, strong operational and research structures that are facile, and good governance. Nebraskan rapid research effort early during a federal quarantine use of U.S. quarantine is described as the first in 50 years are described from these aspects."

original:
- "The optimal time to initiate research on emergencies is before they occur. However, timely initiation of high-quality research may launch during an emergency under the right conditions. These include an appropriate context, clarity in scientific aims, preexisting resources, strong operational and research structures that are facile, and good governance. Here, Nebraskan rapid research efforts early during the 2020 coronavirus disease pandemic, while participating in the first use of U.S. federal quarantine in 50 years, are described from these aspects, as the global experience with this severe emerging infection grew apace. The experience has lessons in purpose, structure, function, and performance of research in any emergency, when facing any threat."
