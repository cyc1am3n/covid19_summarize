summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has spread globally. The virus is being declared pandemic by the WHO. We provide bio-informatic, evolutionary analysis of 351 sequences of its genome. It is aimed at mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of selection. SARS CoV-2 has spread worldwide, infecting more than 150000 people. This is the first time the virus has spread across the world."
