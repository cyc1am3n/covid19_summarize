summary:
- "since December 2019, the infection of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak of new pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Both COVID19 and SARS-CoV invade target cells through ACE2. This article will summarize the role of the virus in multiple organ damage caused by the virus, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development."

original:
- "Since December 2019, the infection of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and caused great public concern. Both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belong to the coronavirus family and both invade target cells through ACE2. An in-depth understanding of ACE2 and a series of physiological and physiological changes caused by the virus invading the human body may help to discover and explain the corresponding clinical phenomena and then deal with them timely. In addition, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target. This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development."
