One patient was admitted to each room alone, with no more than one caregiver. The body temperature of care givers was measuredtwice a day.The floor was sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000 mg/L.

- "Objective: To explorethe proper protective measures for pancreaticdiseases treatment during theoutbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19). Method: Clinical data of four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19from February 2(nd), 2020 to February 9(th), 2020 in pancreatic surgery were reviewed.After the first patientscuffednosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective measures in our department wereupdated.Only one patient was admitted to each room alone, with no more than one caregiver.The body temperature of care givers was measuredtwice a day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000 mg/L.The protective measures for interventional procedures were as follow.Primary protection was applied to the operators ofcentral venipuncture catheter, percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with local anesthesiaand epidural anesthesia.Secondary protection was applied to the operators of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures with general anesthesia. Results: During Feb 2(nd), 2020 to Feb 9(th), 2020, four patients in our department were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which one was died of COVID-19, two were cured, and one is still in hospital for COVID-19.After the update ofprotective measures in our department, no more nosocomial infection of COVID-19occurred.Two central venipuncture catheter, three percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, one percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, one percuteneous transhepatic cholecyst drainage and one open surgery with general anesthesia were performed with no infection of operators. Conclusions: The caregivers of patients are potential infection source of COVID-19.Enhanced protective measures including the management measures of caregivers can decrease the risk of nosocomial infection of COVID-19."
