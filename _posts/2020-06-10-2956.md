- "COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly and overwhelm health systems around the world. Tan Tock Seng Hospital was the epicentre in the coordination and management of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003. Now, together with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital is taking the lead in Singapore's efforts to navigate this pandemic. In dealing with COVID-19, given the scale of the pandemic, surgeons and surgical teams all around the world face unique challenges to daily operations, having to fulfil alternate non-surgical roles while reducing attrition. We hope to share our experience from the perspective of the Division of Surgery, Tan Tock Seng Hospital on our actions in responding to this challenge, in the hope that it may benefit others during this global crisis."
