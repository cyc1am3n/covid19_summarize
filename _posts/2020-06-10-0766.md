summary:
- "the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to progress since its discovery in December of 2019. The Southern China Wholesale Market reportedly has connections to the original 27 cases in Wuhan, China. This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012."

original:
- "The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to progress since its discovery in December of 2019. A cluster of atypical pneumonia identified in Wuhan, China served as the epicenter of this recent epidemic. This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The Southern China Wholesale Market reportedly has connections to the original 27 cases in Wuhan, China. The worldwide confirmed case total has eclipsed 650,000, with over 30,300 deaths (WHO, 2020). Patient presentation ranges from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent death. Early epidemiologic studies of viral spread support the hypothesis that COVID-19 can remain latent with an extended and infectious incubation period. The United States Government has issued level 3 precautions for most international travel along with prohibiting entry to foreign nationals traveling from China, Iran, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and the European Schengen area (e.g. France, Italy, Germany). Prevention remains the mainstay in treating and defeating the COVID-19 epidemic. Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should self-quarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation. The combination of prevention and containment provides the best opportunity to stall the COVID-19 spread."
