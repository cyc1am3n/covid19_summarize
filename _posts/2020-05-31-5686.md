summary:
- "dynamic system with external source introduced to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system. It can be considered as suspected people travel to different areas. Local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people might be out of control. If the local outbreak is out, the local population of the 2019 CoronaVirus may be out. This is one of the most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. We propose a time delay dynamic system is more reliable than the one without it. External source."

- "How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control."
