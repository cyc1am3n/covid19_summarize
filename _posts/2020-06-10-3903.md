summary:
- "there is currently an outbreak of a pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. We evaluate the potential for international dissemination of this disease via commercial air travel should the outbreak continue. There are still several unanswered questions, but we evaluate the possibility of international dissemination if the outbreak continues. The outbreak is expected to continue if there is a continuing outbreak of the disease. It is estimated that the outbreak could spread via air travel."
