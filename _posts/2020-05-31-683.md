summary:
- "coronaviruses (CoVs) can be transmitted via food packaging materials. This review made a comparison between CoVs and the most recognized foodborne virus. There is no clear evidence that CoV can follow fecal-oral routes like human norovirus. The chance of foodborne transmission of the virus is considered low. Covs mainly spread through the respiratory tract. No clear evidence shows CoV is able to follow other foodborne viruses. However, there is no evidence CoV compared to humans and other food-borne viruses are not transmitted via foods."

original:
- "In order to answer the question whether coronaviruses (CoVs) can be transmitted via foods, this review made a comparison between CoVs with the most recognized foodborne virus, human noroviruses (NoVs). As a result, although CoVs indeed have shown the possibilities to remain infectious on foods and/or food packaging materials long enough (from several days to several weeks) to potentially cause transmission, they seem to be less persistent than NoVs towards common disinfection practices with alcohols, chlorine and ultraviolet (UV). More importantly, the chance of foodborne transmission of CoVs is considered low as CoVs mainly spread through the respiratory tract and there is no clear evidence showing CoVs can follow fecal-oral routes like human NoVs and other foodborne viruses."
