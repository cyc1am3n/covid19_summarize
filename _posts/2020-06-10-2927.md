summary:
- "COVID-19 is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV 2 virus. It has affected large populations in over 120 countries. There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical. Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury. The disease has caused pandemic in the world as declared by WHO on March 12, 2020. Until such time an effective vaccine is available, one can repurpose known therapeutic drug molecules such as angiotensive virus caused by the disease."

original:
- "Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has created pandemic in the world as declared by WHO on March 12, 2020. It is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV 2 virus and has affected large populations in over 120 countries. There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical. Until such time that an effective vaccine is available for COVID-19 viral infection, one can repurpose known therapeutic drug molecules such as angiotensin receptor 2 blocker, a commonly used antihypertensive drug, to control COVID-19 virus from gaining entry into the host cell by blocking the angiotensin receptor. Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury in COVID-19 infection."
