- "The outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19) has raised concerns among dentists to develop strategies to prevent infection of dental equipment, materials, and patients during an epidemic period. Strategies following the National Laws and Standards of China and local standards of several provinces for controlling cross-infection and instituting protective measures for medical staff in dental clinics during an epidemic period are discussed. A proposal is put forth for dental clinics that will face similar situations in the future. Further research is warranted to address potential problems that will be encountered under such dire circumstances."
