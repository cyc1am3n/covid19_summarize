summary:
- "COVID-19 outbreak is challenging for hospital care. Development of lean, adaptable algorithms for managing patient flows may be pivotal for handling and adapting to a situation of uncertainty and evolving crisis. Here, we present the model of care adopted at Parma University-Hospital, a large teaching hospital facility located in Northern Italy, to face a massive overflow of patients presenting to the Emergency Department. We present a model adopted at a hospital facility in northern Italy."
