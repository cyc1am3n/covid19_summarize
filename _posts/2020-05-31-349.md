original:
- "This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is to support clinicians and, although recommendations have been provided, it is not a formal guideline. Nor is there sufficient evidence base to conclude that alternative approaches to treatment are incorrect. Instead, it is a consensus written by clinicians with an interest in ITP or coagulation disorders and reviewed by members of the UK ITP forum."
