summary:
- "the recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. We report our modelled homo-trimer structure of spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion. Our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence."

original:
- "The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics."
