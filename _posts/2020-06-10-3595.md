summary:
- "the common methods of re-sterilization do not hold well for filtering facepiece respirators. We propose the validation and eventual use of gamma irradiation to disinfect FFRs in bulk. The common methods are strained due to the shortage precipitated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Re-processing of primary protective equipment is the need of the hour with healthcare systems all over the world strained by the shortage. There is a shortage of protective equipment due to severe acute respirators (FFRs) do not have well for filters as they affect their structure and function."

The common methods of re-sterilization do not hold well for filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) as they affect their structure and function. We propose the validation and eventual use of gamma irradiation, an already existing method of re-sterilization, to disinfect FFRs in bulk."
