summary:
- "COVID-19 threatens millions of lives especially elderly population and people with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Rapid and effective diagnosis are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately. Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting hemogram and serum biochemistry data. The data may be help to find a biomarker which can be used in combination with the CT results for rapid and accurate diagnosis. This article is protected by copyright."

Rapid and effective diagnosis are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus. Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting the hemogram and serum biochemistry data of all infected people by COVID-19 worldwide even they do not show severe symptoms. These data may be help to find a biomarker which can be used in combination with the CT results for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.
