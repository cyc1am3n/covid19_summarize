- "The COVID-19 Pandemic has necessitated drastic changes across the spectrum of healthcare, all of which have occurred with unprecedented rapidity. The need to accommodate change on such a large scale has required ingenuity and decisive thinking. Within the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation we have been faced with many of these challenges. In New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, we were among the first to encounter many of these challenges. One of the largest lessons included learning how to streamline our admissions and transfer process into our acute rehabilitation hospital as part of a concerted effort to make acute care hospital beds available as quickly as possible.
