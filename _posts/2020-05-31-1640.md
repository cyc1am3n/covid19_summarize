summary:
- "COVID-19 severity and mortality can be expected to be significantly greater in elderly patients with head and neck cancer. Increased age, comorbidities, and presence of malignancy are known risk factors for disease severity. A thorough geriatric assessment, which has been shown to be beneficial prior to the COVD-19 pandemic, could be particularly helpful in this patient population. Recruitment of social services and palliative care, when appropriate, may allow for optimal management of these patients. The management requires multidisciplinary consensus and patient input. increased age, mortality and disease severity and death in patients with COVId-19."

original:
- "Elderly patients with head and neck cancer are at increased risk of adverse outcomes during and after treatment of head and neck cancer. COVID-19 severity and mortality can be expected to be significantly greater in elderly patients with head and neck cancer, given that increased age, comorbidities, and presence of malignancy are known risk factors for disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, their management requires multidisciplinary consensus and patient input. A thorough geriatric assessment, which has been shown to be beneficial prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, could be particularly helpful in this patient population with the added dimension of COVID-19 risk. In many cases, prudent treatment plan modification may allow for overall best outcomes. Furthermore, recruitment of social services and, when appropriate, palliative care, may allow for optimal management of these patients."
