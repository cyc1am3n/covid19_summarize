Complicated objective factors such as the long-term existence of source of infection, difficulty in completely blocking the transmission route and a large susceptible population determined that the COVID-19 pandemic might stay with us for long term. Therefore, we should be ready for a tough and long battle against the COVID-19 epidemic. The strategy should adhere to the principle of combining emergency response with regular prevention and control measures, and all efforts should be well harnessed in a coordinated way to keep the epidemic under control while securing the economic and social development."
