summary:
- "Pulmonary complications and infections often affect HNSCC patients. Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness. Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use are important to the long-term management and health of these patients. The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic may disproportionately affect this population."

original:
- "Pulmonary complications and infections frequently affect patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients. RESULTS: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients."
