summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has achieved community spread among humans. Pigs, cats, ferrets, and primates have been??identified as good candidates for susceptibility. The potential implications?indicate the need for One Health surveillance, intervention, and management strategies to mitigate the effects on animal populations and prevent a second preparedness failure during this health emergency."
