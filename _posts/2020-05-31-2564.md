summary:
- "124 medical personnel working in a rural area of Thailand. The average knowledge score was 6.26 + 1.42. There was no association between the total knowledge score and sex or age. Some physicians have a lower knowledge score than nonphysicians medical personnel. If medical personnel are not knowledgeable, it will be to expect successful disease control. It may not be possible for medical personnel to educate the local people. This data implies that itis necessary to improve education about the new disease."

original:
- "Based on the concept of knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) theory, good knowledge is necessary for successful disease control. Here, the authors report a questionnaire study on knowledge of COVID-19 by medical personnel in a rural area of Thailand. The setting is in Nangrong district in a rural province of Thailand, Buriram Province, about 410 km from Bangkok, and next to Cambodia. Briefly, a 10-question questionnaire (Table 1) was used for testing knowledge of overall 124 medical personnel (42 males, 82 females, average age 36.7 + 7.9 years) working in the study area (5 physicians, 81 nurses, 20 nurse assistants, 12 public health workers and 6 other medical workers). The average total knowledge score was 6.26 + 1.42. There was no association between the total knowledge score and sex or age but there was a significant association between total knowledge score and types of medical personnel. There are still many medical personnel that have a low total knowledge score despite the emergence of the disease in Thailand and after several public health policies counteracting the outbreak were implemented. Surprisingly, some physicians have a lower knowledge score than nonphysicians medical personnel. This data implies that itis necessary to improve education about the new disease for medical personnel. If medical personnel are not knowledgeable, it will be to expect successful disease control and it mayt not be possible for medical personnel to educate the local people."
