original:
- "A??new type of coronavirus, i.e. se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in the province of Hubei, China, and over the past four months the number of cases of infection has exceeded 240,000 worldwide, leading to a??pandemia [1]. At the genetic level, 2019-nCoV is closely related to the SARS-CoV and, to a??lesser extent, to MERS-CoV, which appeared as epidemiological threats in recent years in China and the Middle East, respectively. Infections with the Coronaviridae virus family in a??small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of age with a??positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome [2]."
