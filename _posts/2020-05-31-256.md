summary:
- "the clinical course and outcome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is definitely more favourable in children than in adults. The management of COVID-19 in young patients with comorbidities, particularly cancer, remains a challenge for the clinician. More data are required to optimize the clinical approach to these cases. Several cases of infection in children with cancer are described, except for one reported case,(2) the disease was largely asymptomatic."
