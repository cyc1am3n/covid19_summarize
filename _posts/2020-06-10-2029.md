summary:
- "infected coronavirus cases in China have been disregarded in a majority of hard-hit countries globally. Authorities of most developed countries make two primary suggestions to the general public. Neither WHO nor US CDC encourage the use of facial masks. The reasoning can be fivefold. Infected people who are in medical care environments are not encouraged to use them. No one encourages use of masks for general public, he says."

original:
- "The view of an air quality and ventilation expert The rapid global rise of infected coronavirus cases after China dramatically impacts the daily life of everyone in every facet. Schools are closing, people are working from home, and stores are filling with panic shoppers. However, lessons learned the hard way in China have been disregarded in a majority of hard-hit countries globally, such as the enforcement of using facial masks. Authorities of most developed countries make two primary suggestions to the general public: keeping social distance and washing hands. These are surely effective in defeating potential virus dispersion through direct contact and droplet transmission. Neither WHO nor US CDC encourage the usage of facial masks for the general public, rather only for those who are infected and who are in medical care environments. The reasoning can be fivefold.[truncated]"
