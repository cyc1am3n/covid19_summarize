summary:
- "the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in a respiratory specimen cannot be directly interpreted as a potential for disease transmission and infection. Barry Atkinson and Eskild Petersen thank them for their comments on our Article describing the clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients. We agree that a presence of a severe RNA can not be interpreted."
