summary:
- "Informed consent has become a challenging issue when surgery is to be performed. Patients undergoing surgery at the time of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be performed in view of increased risk of the need of intensive care unit (ICU) and associated high mortality if a patient exhibits COVID19 symptoms in the post-operative period. We have devised a new informed consent format for all patients undergoing operation."

We have devised a new informed consent format for all patients undergoing surgery incorporating a few points specific for the disease."
