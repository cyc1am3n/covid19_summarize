summary:
- "COVID-19 patients with early mild pneumonia often lack typical evidence to make a definitive diagnosis. This article finds that early diagnosis requires a combination of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and etiology. Early diagnosis is one of the important contents in prevention and control. The study found that the outbreak in Wuhan, China, spread rapidly throughout China, and gradually to some countries abroad. In this article, 4 cases of the disease were analysed by 4 patients."
