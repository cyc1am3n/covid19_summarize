summary:
- "the evidence on COVID-19 is being produced at high speed, so it is challenging for decision-makers to keep up. We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (L.OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts."

original:
- "Introduction: The evidence on COVID-19 is being produced at high speed, so it is challenging for decision-makers to keep up. It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. Methods and analysis: We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (L.OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts. Ethics and dissemination: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of these articles will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks, and traditional media, and will be sent to relevant international organizations discussing this topic."
