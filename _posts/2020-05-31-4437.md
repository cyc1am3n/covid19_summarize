summary:
- "the coronavirus pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. A study aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health care workers arising from schools."

original:
- "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases."
