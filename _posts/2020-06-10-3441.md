summary:
- "outbreaks of new or reemergent viruses have claimed thousands of lives. The detection and characterization of emergent diseases is an important problem. Bayesian statistical model can detect and characterize previously unknown and unmodeled diseases from patient-care reports and evaluate its performance on historical data. We describe a statistical model that can detect. previously unknown diseases. Over the past decade, outbreaks have cost governments and healthcare systems billions of dollars. Since the appearance of new and transformed diseases is likely to continue, the detection and characterizing new or transformed diseases have cost billions."

Because the appearance of new or transformed diseases is likely to continue, the detection and characterization of emergent diseases is an important problem. We describe a Bayesian statistical model that can detect and characterize previously unknown and unmodeled diseases from patient-care reports and evaluate its performance on historical data."
