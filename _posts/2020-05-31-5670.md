The number of patients who were suspected as having H1N1 influenza grew to 1687 within two weeks. On May 27, when the mayor of Kobe city declared the emergency had subsided. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared H1N1 influenza as a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Details of this are described elsewhere4,5 . I am a psychiatrist but also worked at an outpatient unit that screened for H1N1 was worried about being infected. However, the chief of my department led the way by personally consulting at the outpatient unit, which motivated me to join as well. My experience made me conduct a cross-sectional survey about the willingness and hesitation to work during the H1N1 pandemic with 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city between June and July, 20096 ."
