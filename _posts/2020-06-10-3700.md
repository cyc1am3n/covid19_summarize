summary:
- "the level of preparedness shown by countries around the world, including most advanced economies, was wildly insufficient. Such attempts arrived too late, and were hampered by fragmented governance, as well as lack of an EU-wide risk and crisis management framework. The pandemic was predictable, and yet preparedness was insufficient, we argue. European Commission has sought more coordinated action, but such attempts were too late. However, such attempts failed to arrive too late and were hindered by fragmentation of governance. We argue that preparedness showed by countries in the world was predictable. Countries around the globe, including advanced economies."

original:
- "In this article we argue that the pandemic was predictable, and yet the level of preparedness shown by countries around the world, including most advanced economies, was wildly insufficient. For what concerns the European Union, more coordinated action would have been desirable and has also been sought by the European Commission; however, such attempts arrived too late, and were hampered by fragmented governance, as well as by the lack of an EU-wide risk and crisis management framework."
