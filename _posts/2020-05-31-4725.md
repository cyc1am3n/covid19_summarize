summary:
- "keratoconjunctivitis is the first such reported case in North America. This patient presented initially to ophthalmology. It developed worsening symptoms over the course of the next several days. The case emphasizes the importance of ensuring that first-line health care providers consider COVID-19 on the differential. Having a high index of suspicion with this presentation would allow for appropriate precautions to be taken to prevent further spread."

original:
- "We present a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an initial medical presentation of keratoconjunctivitis, the first such reported case in North America. This patient presented initially to ophthalmology with keratoconjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms, without fever, and developed worsening symptoms over the course of the next several days. This case emphasizes the importance of ensuring that first-line health care providers, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, emergency physicians, and family physicians, consider COVID-19 on the differential for any patient with recent travel who presents with acute conjunctivitis. Having a high index of suspicion with this presentation would allow for appropriate precautions to be taken to prevent further spread of COVID-19."
