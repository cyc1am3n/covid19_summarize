summary:
- "the global COVID-19 death toll stands at the time of writing at 163,500. Policy makers in both the global north as well as the global south rose to the challenge. Discipline specific responses translated into many global collaborative efforts aimed at developing treatments, modelling of the impact of varying policy options on the continuing pandemic, preventive vaccine trials, and so on. Comparisons between UK and Germany or between Brazil and PR of China show."

original:
- "The global COVID-19 death toll stands at the time of writing at 163,500. By the time you read this, that number will have increased significantly, and it is likely that we won't have seen the end of it by that time. Policy makers in both the global north as well as the global south rose to the challenge, with decidedly mixed responses as well as decidedly mixed results, as comparisons between reported case loads of, say the UK and Germany or between Brazil and the PR of China, show. Discipline specific responses translated into many global collaborative efforts aimed at developing treatments, modelling of the impact of varying policy options on the continuing pandemic, preventive vaccine trials, and so on and so forth."
