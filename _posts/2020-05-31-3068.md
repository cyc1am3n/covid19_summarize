summary:
- "the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by March 2020. Containment measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene were recommended. The findings indicate the importance of acknowledging extroversion and conscientiousness traits as relevant to people's engagement with containment measures. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared an outbreak of the novel Corona virus. In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with a sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults in China was likely to be a deadly virus in December 2019."

- "INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) probably occurred in Wuhan, China. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a pandemic. Containment measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene were recommended. In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures. OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent two personality traits, extroversion and conscientiousness, are associated with engagement with two containment measures (social distancing and handwashing). METHODS: The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). RESULTS: Higher scores for extroversion were associated with lower means for social distancing (p < 0.001) and higher scores for conscientiousness were associated with higher means for social distancing and handwashing (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the importance of acknowledging extroversion and conscientiousness traits as relevant to people's engagement with the measures recommended for COVID-19 containment."
