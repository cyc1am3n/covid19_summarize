title: "Risks Posed to Corneal Transplant Recipients by COVID-19-Affected Donors"

summary:
- "the recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant human disease COVID-19 will likely have a significant impact on corneal tissue donor pool. Current recommendations from the U.S. and global eye bank associations call for the outright avoidance of tissues from donors recently exposed to or infected. The rapidly increasing global prevalence and mortality of the disease threatens the tenability of current tissue exclusion guidelines."

original:
- "The recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant human disease, COVID-19, will likely have a significant impact on the corneal tissue donor pool. Current recommendations from the United States and global eye bank associations call for the outright avoidance of tissues from donors recently infected with or exposed to COVID-19. This conservative recommendation is currently appropriate given the reported ocular sequelae, tear film viral detectability, and transmissibility of COVID-19. However, the rapidly increasing global prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 threatens the tenability of current tissue exclusion guidelines, and may necessitate their relaxation in the near future."
