link: "https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2020.33"
author:
- Germain, Sabrina

summary:
- "the paper unpacks why the allocation of healthcare resources is fundamentally a question of justice in Britain. The paper explains why healthcare law and policy require a philosophical approach in times of crucial change and crisis. It concludes that the liberal egalitarian conception of distributive justice at the heart of the NHS is now in jeopardy and is being replaced by a utilitarian approach, based on a priority ranking of patients for the provision of services at this critical time."

original:
- "The paper first unpacks why the allocation of healthcare resources is fundamentally a question of justice in Britain and explains why healthcare law and policy require a philosophical approach in times of crucial change and crisis. Secondly, the paper provides a critical analysis of the current situation for the allocation of healthcare resources and the provision of services to patients directly or indirectly affected by the virus. It concludes that the liberal egalitarian conception of distributive justice at the heart of the NHS that aims to guarantee free and equal access to healthcare is now in jeopardy and is being replaced by a utilitarian approach, based on a priority ranking of patients for the provision of services at this critical time."
