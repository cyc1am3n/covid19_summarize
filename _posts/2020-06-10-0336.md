summary:
- "During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 healthcare workers accounted for 21% of victims worldwide and 43% of SARS patients in Toronto were healthcare workers1. This was likely multifactorial, including a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), unrecognized cases and inadequate PPE used1,2. Aerosol generating medical procedures are interventions that can cause airborne infectious particles to be propelled into the air."

original:
- "Protection of frontline healthcare workers during the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) is essential. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 healthcare workers accounted for 21% of victims worldwide and 43% of SARS patients in Toronto were healthcare workers1 . This was likely multifactorial, including a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), unrecognized cases and inadequate PPE used1,2. This risk was greatest to nurses working in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units2 . Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are interventions that can cause airborne infectious particles to be propelled into the air. Due to their small size and potential to be suspended in the air for prolonged periods, additional precautions are required for healthcare workers who are exposed to AGMPs. Obtaining an accurate history and COVID-19 risk factors for patients in cardiac arrest is difficult, therefore we suggest presuming all patients presenting vital signs absent (VSA) to be infectious with COVID-19. The purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations to enhance staff and patient safety during COVID-19 by reducing unnecessary exposure to AGMPs for ED staff, paramedics and other ED patients when receiving patients with VSA. We suggest hospitals and emergency medical services engage with appropriate stakeholders and adjust accordingly for local practice. Summary of evidence: Available evidence supporting which specific procedures are AGMP are all of low level of evidence and sometimes have conflicting results. Much of the data regarding the risk of aerosolization and transmission of pathogens causing acute respiratory infections comes from the SARS outbreak in 2003 making it challenging to draw conclusions from which specific procedures had risks of transmission . To aid in justification of our recommendations, we present a brief summary of available evidence regarding common AGMPs that occur during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the risks of transmission to healthcare workers."
