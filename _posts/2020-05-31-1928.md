summary:
- "autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are potentially life-threatening disorders. Corticosteroids and non-steroid immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of treatment. Treatment can be challenging particularly in pemphigus, mucous membrane Pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita which may require more intense immunosuppressive approaches."

original:
- "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are potentially life-threatening disorders comprising intra-epidermal/epithelial (pemphigus) and sub-epidermal/epithelial blistering diseases (pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis). Corticosteroids and non-steroid immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of treatment. Treatment can be challenging particularly in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita which may require more intense immunosuppressive approaches."
