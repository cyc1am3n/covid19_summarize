summary:
- "the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 were managed by a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in Marseille, France. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected over the study period. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients. Early recognition is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation. Rapid virology is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected cases."

original:
- "Rapid virological diagnosis is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected COVID-19 cases. METHOD: We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately three hours of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation."
