summary:
- "COVID-19 is the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) There is very limited evidence base to formulate specific advice for dermatology patients on immunomodulators. The following is based on expert opinion, taking into account known risks of influenza and other, positive-sense single-stranded, RNA virus infections. An Australia/New Zealand consensus document is in development. There is a consensus document in development for the disease."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). There is very limited evidence base to formulate specific advice for dermatology patients on immunomodulators with regards to COVID-19. The following is based on expert opinion, taking into account known risks of influenza (a negative sense single-stranded RNA virus) and other, positive-sense single-stranded, RNA virus infections (such as SARS, MERS, and the common cold). An Australia/New Zealand consensus document is in development."
