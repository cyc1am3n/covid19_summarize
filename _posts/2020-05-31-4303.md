summary:
- "In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide. Unlike SARS and MERS, secondary transmission occurs in large numbers within families. One family member is a kidney transplant recipient. The initial clinical symptoms were the same, but their progression was different. In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care. All three family members made a full recovery."

original:
- "In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide. Unlike SARS and MERS, where secondary transmission mostly occurred in hospital settings, COVID-19 transmission occurs in large numbers within families. Herein we report three cases of a familial cluster with one family member being a kidney transplant recipient. The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different. Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward. In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care. All three family members made a full recovery."
