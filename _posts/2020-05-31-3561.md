summary:
- "SPECT/CT and PET/CT examinations may reveal findings of Covid-19 associated pneumonia (C-19AP) on localizing CT. Nuclear Medicine physicians must develop diagnostic skills for timely recognition of typical findings of C-19AP. We offer several steps following an encounter suspicious of the disease. Spect/CT, PET and PET examinations during the Covid19 pandemic may incidentally reveal findings. It is critical for nuclear medicine physicians to develop diagnosing skills. This is critical to know the optimal practices for safely isolating and PET tests are critical for patients undergoing routine CT on a localizing pneumonia."

It is critical for Nuclear Medicine physicians to develop diagnostic skills for timely recognition of typical findings of C-19AP on a localizing CT. Furthermore, it is our responsibility to know the optimal practices for safely isolating and managing such patients while protecting the staff, other patients at the facility, family and/or friend accompanying the patients, and the public in general from risky exposure to Covid-19 sources. We offer several steps following an encounter suspicious of C-19AP."
