summary:
- "the clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. PCR testing for Novel coronavirus can help to make a quick diagnosis."

original:
- "Introduction: Novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect all age groups. The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this group can help to make a quick diagnose. Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition. Conclusion: When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus."
