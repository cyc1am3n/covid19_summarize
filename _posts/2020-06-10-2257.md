summary:
- "unbiased sequencing was used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV. It formed another clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing. The virus is the seventh member of the family that infects humans. In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China."

original:
- "In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed another clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing.
