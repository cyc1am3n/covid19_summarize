- "Objectives Drug repositioning, that is, the use of a drug in an indication other than the one for which it was initially marketed, is a growing trend. Its origins lie mainly in the attrition experienced in recent years in the field of new drug discovery. Key findings Despite some regulatory and economic challenges, drug repositioning offers many advantages, and a number of recent successes have confirmed both its public health benefits and its commercial value. The first examples of successful drug repositioning mainly came about through serendipity like acetylsalicylic acid, thalidomide, sildenafil or dimethylfumarate. Conclusion The history of great-repositioned drugs has given some solutions to various pathologies. Serendipity is not yet useful to find repositioning drugs. Drug repositioning is of growing interest. Nowadays, a more rational approach to the identification of drug candidates for repositioning is possible, especially using data mining."
