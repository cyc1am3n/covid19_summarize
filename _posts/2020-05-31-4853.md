summary:
- "governments must decide if discriminating against foreign suppliers is part of solution? or whether foreign know-how and resources can be tapped for mutual advantage. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. During the crisis, written and unwritten international rules are tested, with consequences that can last well after the crisis dominated headlines. In our interconnected world, when a global crisis occurs governments must sacrifice open borders on the altar of some other goal. If the crisis is dominated by headlines, government must decide whether discriminating if foreign suppliers are part of the solution. Decisions are influenced by other governments."

Decisions to sacrifice open borders on the altar of some other goal are typically influenced by the steps?real or perceived?taken by other governments. At such times, written and unwritten international rules are tested, with consequences that can last well after the crisis dominated headlines. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception."
