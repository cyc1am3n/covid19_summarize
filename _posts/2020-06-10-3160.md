title: "[The SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and an Attempted Suicide of a Patient with Delusional Disorder]"

summary:
- "the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered increased symptoms of an undiagnosed delusional disorder at a mid-60-year-old woman resulting in an attempted suicide. It seems likely that people with previously subclinical psychotic illnesses are more often admitted to psychiatric care for the first time. Building a therapeutic relationship and integrating her into an outpatient clinic was possible despite her lack of insight into the illness and her rejection of medical treatment."

- "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered increasing symptoms of an undiagnosed delusional disorder at a mid-60-year-old woman resulting in an attempted suicide. Because of a pandemic with noticeable and visible social changes, it seems likely that people with previously subclinical psychotic illnesses are more often admitted to psychiatric care for the first time. Building a therapeutic relationship and integrating her into an outpatient clinic was possible despite her lack of insight into the illness and her rejection of medical treatment."
