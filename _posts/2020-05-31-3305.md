summary:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 is sweeping across the globe. Most patients have mild to moderate symptoms, but a subgroup will become severely ill. Factors associated with ICU admission and death include older age, comorbid conditions, elevated body mass index, lymphopenia, elevated transaminases, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R). Most patients will have mild and moderate symptoms."
