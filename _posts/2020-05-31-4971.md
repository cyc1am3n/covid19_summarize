summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported at the end of 2019 in China. By end of February 2020, the virus has spread worldwide through continuous human-to-human transmission via contact and droplet infection. This is demonstrating the ease with which emerging viruses disperse globally through the mass transport system. Here we summarize our knowledge of other coronanaviruses that have infected humans in comparison with SARS- CoV-2."
