summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported to induce a hypercoagulable state1 which is associated with disease severity and poor outcomes. Rates of thromboembolic events are therefore the subject of significant interest. The clinical manifestations of this procoagulant tendency are poorly defined. In this report we describe two cases of major occlusive arterial events in previously asymptomatic individuals with confirmed COVID-19. This is attributed to poor outcomes and disease severity."
