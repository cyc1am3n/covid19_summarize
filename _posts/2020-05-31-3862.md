summary:
- "AI algorithms are increasingly being used to provide insights that can lead to better health policy and management. However, as these technologies are still in their infancy stages, slow progress is being made in their adoption for serious consideration at national and international policy levels. The precision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven algorithms are gaining in accuracy. This paper explores how early viral detection will reduce in time as computing technology is enhanced. It will render enhanced AI predictive tools which will influence future urban health policy internationally. AI modelling driven by companies such as BlueDot and Metabiota have demonstrated success in providing insights."

- "Predictive computing tools are increasingly being used and have demonstrated successfulness in providing insights that can lead to better health policy and management. However, as these technologies are still in their infancy stages, slow progress is being made in their adoption for serious consideration at national and international policy levels. However, a recent case evidences that the precision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven algorithms are gaining in accuracy. AI modelling driven by companies such as BlueDot and Metabiota anticipated the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China before it caught the world by surprise in late 2019 by both scouting its impact and its spread. From a survey of past viral outbreaks over the last 20 years, this paper explores how early viral detection will reduce in time as computing technology is enhanced and as more data communication and libraries are ensured between varying data information systems. For this enhanced data sharing activity to take place, it is noted that efficient data protocols have to be enforced to ensure that data is shared across networks and systems while ensuring privacy and preventing oversight, especially in the case of medical data. This will render enhanced AI predictive tools which will influence future urban health policy internationally."
