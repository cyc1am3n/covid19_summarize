summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2, a new human coronavirus, has generated global concern. We and others in China were involved in the initial genome sequencing of the virus. Herein we describe what genomic data reveal about the emergence of the new virus and discuss the gaps in our understanding of its origins. The pandemic has generated enormous global concern, with some in China involved in its genome sequencing. There are questions about the virus's origins and the origins of its emergence."
