summary:
- "Using a nontoxic fluorescent solution, only visible under ultraviolet light, was used during the training. This solution was sprayed on and given as a nebulized treatment to a high-fidelity simulator during the scenario. The innovative training method demonstrated that following the PPE training improves workplace safety and decreases the risk of transmission. Healthcare workers have substantial concerns about the effectiveness of the personal protective equipment."

original:
- "Healthcare workers have substantial concerns about the effectiveness of the personal protective equipment. Staff desired a refresher training with individual feedback of their abilities to don and doff effectively and assurance that if they donned and doffed correctly their equipment was effective. A nontoxic fluorescent solution, only visible under ultraviolet light, was utilized during the training. This solution was sprayed on and given as a nebulized treatment to a high-fidelity simulator during the scenario. It allowed educators and learners to easily visualize any contamination. This innovative training method demonstrated that following the PPE training improves workplace safety and decreases the risk of transmission"
