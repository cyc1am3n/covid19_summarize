summary:
- "the COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to reach the late stage since late March 2020. Risk assessment for such economic restoration is of significance. Our work may inform provincial governments to make risk level-based, differentiated control measures. We estimated the probability of the outbreak caused by work resuming in typical provinces/cities and found that such probability is very limited (&amp;lt;5% for all the regions except Beijing) Risk assessment is of importance."

original:
- "The COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to reach the late stage since late March 2020, and a stepwise restoration of economic operations is implemented. Risk assessment for such economic restoration is of significance. Here, we estimated the probability of COVID-19 resurgence caused by work resuming in typical provinces/cities and found that such probability is very limited (&amp;lt;5% for all the regions except Beijing). Our work may inform provincial governments to make risk level-based, differentiated control measures."
