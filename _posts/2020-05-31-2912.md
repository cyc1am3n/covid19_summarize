summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus pandemic. 71% of patients who eventually died matched ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation. This percentage was only 0.6% in patients who survived. A large number of these patients end up in the intensive care units with critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy."

original:
- "In March 2020, the global healthcare system is overwhelmed by patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-2019). A large number of these patients end up in the intensive care units (ICU) with critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy. In a recent cohort study 71% of patients who eventually died matched the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), while this percentage was only 0.6% in patients who survived."
