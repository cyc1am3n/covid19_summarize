summary:
- "the asymptomatic carrier state of COVID-19 has become a topic of concern for preventing a possible epidemic rebound. The author presents the limited available data about infectiousness of cases and their possible contributions to the overall epidemic. Challenges of a second epidemic wave of COVD-19 caused by adolescent and pre-symptomatic cases are discussed and suggestions for control strategies and scientific research are provided. This review describes and defines the COVID-19 carrier state and outlines methods for counting and reporting these cases can be further divided into a symptomatic infection and a problem in China. Author presents limited data."

original:
- "The asymptomatic carrier state of COVID-19 has become a topic of concern for preventing a possible epidemic rebound. This review describes and defines the COVID-19 asymptomatic carrier state and outlines methods for identifying counting and reporting these cases. The author elaborates that the asymptomatic carrier state can be further divided into asymptomatic infection and pre-symptomatic infection after extended follow-up based on the nature of disease progression. The author presents the limited available data about infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases and their possible contributions to the overall epidemic of COVID-19 observed so far in China. Challenges of a possible second epidemic wave of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are discussed and suggestions for control strategies and scientific research are provided."
