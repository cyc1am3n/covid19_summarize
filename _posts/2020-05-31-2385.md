summary:
- "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBs may raise expression of ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ARBs does not increase ACE2-expression in patients with COVID-19. ACEI/ARB use increases the risk of complications. Patients being treated with such medications should continue their use for approved indications."

original:
- "Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19, based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBS than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications."
