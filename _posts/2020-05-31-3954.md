summary:
- "COVID-19 infections among non-clinical staff have emerged since March 28. There are three patterns of transmission occurring in the hospital. Figure 1 illustrates a timeline of the spread of the disease. The first positive case was a medical worker (P87) who contracted the coronavirus from the outside. No HCW, non-COVID19 inpatients and visitors had tested positive for the virus. Since March 28, the COVID-19 infections have emerged. A total of 21 out of 32 (65%) cases have been reported in hospital have emerged in the dining hall."

original:
- "There are three patterns of the transmission occurring in the hospital: 1) between healthcare workers (HCW), 2) from COVID-19 patients to HCW, and 3) from non-clinical hospital staff to the others. Figure 1 illustrates a timeline of the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital, tracing from the first confirmed case on March 20 to the most recent case on March 30. The first positive case was a medical worker (P87), who was in close contact with a COVID-19 infected nurse (P86) [2]. Except the two infected cases P86 and P28 who contracted the coronavirus from the outside, no HCW, non-COVID-19 inpatients and visitors had tested positive for the coronavirus. And since March 28, the COVID-19 infections among non-clinical staff have emerged, and subsequently a total of 21 out of the 32 (65%) infected cases were non-clinical staff working in the dining hall of the hospital. As the catering workers were responsible for preparing meals, delivering food and hot water to patients and visitors daily over the hospital, it is likely that the non-clinical staff is the main contributor to the disease spread. Healthcare associated infection has previously been known as a characteristic of coronavirus-related diseases and a leading route for spread [3]."
