summary:
- "14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration and time to virus recrudescence respectively. This suggests the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in patients. CoVID patients have been tested positive for RT PCR tests. 14.5% had positive tests after discharge, compared to 14.5%. The findings suggest there are additional measures needed to confirm diagnosis. RTPCR testing was needed."

original:
- "We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (r= -0.637; p=0.002) and time to virus recrudescence (r= 0.52; p=0.008) respectively, suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients."
