summary:
- "Poisson regression analysis showed a possible association between low temperature and increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Both monthly inbound visitors from China in January 2020 and mean temperature in February 2020 are associated with the cumulative number of cases on March 16, 2020. We introduced the monthly number of patients per 1,000,000 population to an additional explanatory variable in the model. RESULTS: Low temperature and higher risk of infection in Japan. Further evaluation would be desirable at a global level."

- "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of temperature on the infectivity of COVID-19 in Japan. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between the accumulated number of patients per 1,000,000 population and the average temperature in February 2020 in each prefecture by Poisson regression analysis. We introduced the monthly number of inbound visitors from China in January 2020 in each prefecture as an additional explanatory variable in the model. RESULTS: Both monthly inbound visitors from China in January 2020 and mean temperature in February 2020 are associated with the cumulative number of COVID-19 case on March 16, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed a possible association between low temperature and increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further evaluation would be desirable at a global level."
