summary:
- "applications of nanobiotechnology could be a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses. There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among them. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronanavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome. and severe adrenavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples. Nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors are also presented. The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials in this field are also present."

original:
- "Nanotechnology and nanomedicine have excellent potential in dealing with a range of different health problems, including viruses, which are considered to be a serious challenge in the medical field. Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses. There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples. This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses. The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented."
