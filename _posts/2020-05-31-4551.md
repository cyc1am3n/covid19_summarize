summary:
- "the error between the model and the official data curve is quite small. It realized forward prediction and backward inference of the epidemic situation. The relevant analysis help relevant countries to make decisions. This paper studies the transmission process of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) The error between model and data curve was quite small, and it realized forward predictions. At the same time, the relevant analysis helped relevant countries make decisions, and the appropriate analysis helped. Using official data modeling, it analyzed the transmission of the disease Virus is very small compared to the model is a little. the data curve and the. analysis."
