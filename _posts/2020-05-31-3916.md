summary:
- "the lockdown implemented as of 9 March had a positive impact. The central and southern regions of Italy implemented restrictive measures to contain the spread of the infection. It is possible to estimate it, based on mortality data and the assumptive case-fatality rate of the disease. When the true prevalence of a disease is unknown, it is possible estimate it. In Italy, the estimated period-prevalence of COVID-19 in Italy varies from 0.35% in Sicity to 13."

original:
- "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, the Italian Government implemented several restrictive measures to contain the spread of the infection. Data shows that, among these measures, the lockdown implemented as of 9 March had a positive impact, in particular?? the central and southern regions of Italy, while other actions appeared to be less effective. When the true prevalence of a disease is unknown, it is possible estimate it, based on mortality data and the assumptive case-fatality rate of the disease. Given these assumptions, the estimated period-prevalence of COVID-19 in Italy varies from 0.35% in Sicity to 13.3% in Lombardy."
