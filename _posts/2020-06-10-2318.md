summary:
- "Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment and developing synergistic antiviral coatings are only two of the cases discussed. Our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies. Readers&rsquo; feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged. We would like to share with the readership our vision of the role a (nano)materials scientist can play in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The two fields have some important points of contact are discussed, developing personal protective equipment and. personal protection. coatings. anti-antiviral."

original:
- "Since 2004, we have been developing nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties, the so-called nanoantimicrobials. When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, we started investigating new and challenging routes to nanoantivirals. The two fields have some important points of contact. We would like to share with the readership our vision of the role a (nano)materials scientist can play in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As researchers specifically working on surfaces and nanomaterials, in this letter we underline the importance of nanomaterial-based technological solutions in several aspects of the fight against the virus. While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread. Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment, developing synergistic antiviral coatings, are only two of the cases discussed. This is not the first nor the last pandemic: our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies. Readers&rsquo; feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged."
