summary:
- "COVID-19 has disparities in disease progression. Some patients develop progressive and severe disease while others the course is benign. It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet' We make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention. In the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless. Despite some risk factors, the reasons for the disparities are unclear."

original:
- "While some risk factors have been identified, the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with COVID-19 are unclear, with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign. Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless. It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet'. With evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality, we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention."
