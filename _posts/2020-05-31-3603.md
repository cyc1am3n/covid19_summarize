summary:
- "there is ongoing debate on the safety of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in COVID-19. Recently published studies highlight a potential relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVD. This article aims to summarise the evidence on the use of RAS inhibitors. The research focuses on safety issues of the RAS. inhibitors and their relationship with COVID-19. It is aimed at focusing on safety concerns. There is a possible link between cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies. Research. It's ongoing debate. A potential relationship."
