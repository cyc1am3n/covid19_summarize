summary:
- "an accurate closed-form solution is obtained to the SIR Epidemic Model. The solution is created by analytically continuing the divergent power series solution. It matches the long-time asymptotic behavior of the epidemic model. An accurate solution is developed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Asymptotic Approximants, the solution is a close-form. the solution was used to a COVD-19 Pandemic panded. A solution is used to the analytical form is obtained. Analysed based on an accurate."

original:
- "An accurate closed-form solution is obtained to the SIR Epidemic Model through the use of Asymptotic Approximants (Barlow et al., 2017). The solution is created by analytically continuing the divergent power series solution such that it matches the long-time asymptotic behavior of the epidemic model. The utility of the analytical form is demonstrated through its application to the COVID-19 pandemic."
