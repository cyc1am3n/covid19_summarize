summary:
- "human lungs single cell RNA sequencing data from healthy donors were analyzed to isolate and specifically study gene expression in alveolar type. Genetic expression was analyzed by healthy donors (elderly and young; GEO accession number GSE122960) gene expression was isolated and specifically studied. RNA sequence data analyzed... to isolate gene expression...... and study RNA expression. Human lungs genome sequencing data... were compared to healthy donors. Genome expression was studied to isolate, specifically study... single cell sequencing data were RNA RNAs. human donors lungs data. DNA sequencing data was."
