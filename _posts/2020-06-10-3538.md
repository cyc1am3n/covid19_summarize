summary:
- "COVID-19 is the first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019. No healthcare-associated transmission occurred. We suggest sustainable and scalable control measures developed based on lessons learned from SARS. The first case was hospitalized in Toronto, Canada. There was no transmission of the disease. In the face of a potential pandemic, we suggest sustainable control measures."
