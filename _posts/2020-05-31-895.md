original:
- "In order to manage the urgent psychological need for support in response to the anticipated reaction of the population to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by implementing a centralised psychological support system for all of Tunisia. We set up a helpline which is accessible throughout the country, including those without access to Internet. This model integrates medical students, child and adolescent psychiatrists, psychiatrists, psychologists and social services to provide psychological intervention to the general population and medical staff. It will make a sound basis for developing a more effective psychological crisis intervention response system."
