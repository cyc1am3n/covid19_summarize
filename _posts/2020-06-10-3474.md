original:
- "We read with interest the article by Taxonera et al outlining a high incidence of diarrhoea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).[1] The relationship between these symptoms and faecal calprotectin would be interesting to note. In patients without IBD and COVID-19, faecal calprotectin was noted to be higher in patients with continuing than resolved diarrhoea, suggesting intestinal inflammation due to COVID-19.[2]."
