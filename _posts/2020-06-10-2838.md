summary:
- "scientists must openly share their knowledge, expertise, tools, and technology. Models are critical tools for anticipating, predicting, and responding to complex biological, social, and environmental crises. They are essential for guiding regional and national governments in designing health policies to manage the spread of disease and lessen its impacts. Scientists must also share their model code so that the results can be replicated and evaluated. Presented modeling results alone is not enough."

original:
- "A hallmark of science is the open exchange of knowledge. At this time of crisis, it is more important than ever for scientists around the world to openly share their knowledge, expertise, tools, and technology. Scientific models are critical tools for anticipating, predicting, and responding to complex biological, social, and environmental crises, including pandemics. They are essential for guiding regional and national governments in designing health, social, and economic policies to manage the spread of disease and lessen its impacts. However, presenting modeling results alone is not enough. Scientists must also openly share their model code so that the results can be replicated and evaluated."
