summary:
- "the overall rate of conjunctivitis was 1.1%; it was 3% and 0.7% in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. Patients with severe COVID-19 had an increased incidence. This was a warning sign of poor outcomes. It is more frequent in severe COVId and may be warning sign. The study was performed by a meta-analysis. Three studies, including 1167 patients, reported the incidence at admission to the hospital. CONCLUSIONS. rate of the incidence was.. 1.1%, it was 0."

original:
- "There are sparse data in literature regarding conjunctivitis incidence in COVID-19 and its relationship with disease severity. The objective of this metanalysis was to assess the association between conjunctivitis and the severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis with studies that included patients with severe vs non-severe form of COVID-19 infection. Severe COVID-19 infection was defined as severe pneumonia, mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), use of mechanical ventilation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) treatment. RESULTS: Three studies, including 1167 patients, reported the incidence of conjunctivitis at admission to the hospital. The overall rate of conjunctivitis was 1.1%; it was 3% and 0.7% in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. Patients with severe COVID-19 had an increased incidence of conjunctivitis (O.R.:3.4; 95% C.I.:1.1-10.2; p=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctivitis is more frequent in severe COVID and may be a warning sign of poor outcomes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
