title: "MSCs transplantation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 treatment"

summary:
- "SARS-Cov-2 is spread all over the world, becoming a serious threat to people's health. Mesenchymal stem cells have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. MSCs can reduce the level of pulmonary fibrosis and enhance tissue injury repair. The mortality rate of severe patients after infection is high, but there is no effective treatment. Infection has a strong infection, and there is a high mortality rate. There are no effective treatments to treat the disease. We comment the efficacy of cytokine storm syndrome in the world."

original:
- "At present, SARS-Cov-2 is spread all over the world, becoming a serious threat to people's health. SARS-Cov-2 has a strong infection, and the mortality rate of severe patients after infection is high, but there is no effective treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, which can reduce the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the same time, MSCs can reduce the level of pulmonary fibrosis and enhance tissue injury repair. In this short report, combined with the progress of preclinical and clinical research, we comment the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19."
