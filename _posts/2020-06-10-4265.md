summary:
- "Fang et al. reported in this journal that viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs was longer in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared with non-ICU patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) One participant had mild, 5 moderate, 3 severe, and 2 critical disease. All patients were discharged; no one died. Viral loads for each sample are shown in Table 1."

original:
- "Fang et al. reported in this journal that viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs was longer in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared with non-ICU patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).1 COVID-19 encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of illness, ranging from asymptomatic and mild infections, to severely ill cases in 4-16%.2,3 Here, we report the findings of a prospective cohort study to determine viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in mild to critical severity of illness, and the temporal viral burden at different body sites. We included the first eleven laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in two hospitals in Hong Kong in February 2020. Disease severity was categorized as previously defined.3 We collected serial upper (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, N=75) and lower respiratory tract samples (sputum and tracheal aspirate, N=43), peripheral blood plasma (N=50), urine (N=43) and stool (N=43) samples from all participants, and monitored SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in these samples.4 One participant had mild, 5 moderate, 3 severe, and 2 critical disease. All patients were discharged; no one died. Their clinical and epidemiological features are shown in Table 1. Viral loads for each sample are shown"
