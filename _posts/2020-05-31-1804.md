summary:
- "COVID-19 outbreak is all but guaranteed to do serious damage to state and local economies. Superintendents can look to their data systems to help identify those students and families that are most likely to need social services to make it through this phase and beyond. But even while racing to ensure students have access to regular meals, they cannot afford to ignore the longer-term challenges that their districts will face. CoVId-19 is not just as important as the need to move instruction online, he says."

original:
- "In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, school district leaders? most immediate priority was to ensure that students have access to regular meals. However, efforts to provide a range of other social services must follow close behind. As a start, superintendents can look to their data systems to help them identify those students and families that are most likely to need social services to make it through this phase and beyond. But even while racing to ensure students? health and safety, they cannot afford to ignore the longer-term challenges that their districts will face, given not just the need to move instruction online but also given that COVID-19 is all but guaranteed to do serious damage to state and local economies."
