original:
- "The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has significant potential cardiovascular implications for patients. These include myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies with heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and venous thromboembolic events. We describe a Caribbean-Black gentleman with COVID-19 infection presenting with atrial arrhythmias, namely, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, which resolved with rate and rhythm control strategies, and supportive care."
