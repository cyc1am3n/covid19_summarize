summary:
- "Despite emergency surgical embolectomy, her clinical conditions continued to deteriorate. COVID-19 may have a thrombogenic effect and it may need to be considered in cases of pulmonary embolism and in absence of any obvious risk factor. A clot in a patent foramen ovale was noted. She was put on extracorporeal life support and tested positive. The patient died of multiorgan failure on day 10. There are no associated symptoms of infections."

original:
- "Acute pulmonary embolism is an uncharacteristic presentation in patients with COVID-19. Here we describe the case of a young woman presenting with severe pulmonary embolism, without any associated symptoms of infections. A clot in a patent foramen ovale was noted. Despite emergency surgical embolectomy, her clinical conditions continued to deteriorate. She was put on extracorporeal life support and tested positive for COVID-19. She died of multiorgan failure on day 10. COVID-19 may have a thrombogenic effect and it may need to be considered in cases of pulmonary embolism and in absence of any obvious risk factor."
