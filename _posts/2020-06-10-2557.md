summary:
- "88-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 presented with ARDS and septic shock. Patient had exquisite blood pressure sensitivity to low-dose angiotensin II (Ang-2), allowing for rapid liberation from high-dose vasopressors. Case is suggestive of a potential role for synthetic Ang-2 for patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm clinical efficacy."

original:
- "We report the case of an 88-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who presented with ARDS and septic shock. The patient had exquisite blood pressure sensitivity to low-dose angiotensin II (Ang-2), allowing for rapid liberation from high-dose vasopressors. We hypothesize that sensitivity to Ang-2 might be related to biologic effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our case is suggestive of a potential role for synthetic Ang-2 for patients with COVID-19 and septic shock. Further studies are needed to confirm our observed clinical efficacy."
