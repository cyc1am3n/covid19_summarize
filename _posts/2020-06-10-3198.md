summary:
- "coronavirus pandemic has brought about unprecedented adaptations in healthcare management. In this situation we are obliged as clinicians and academics to share our experiences in order to pool together vital information that will not only help to tackle the matter at hand but will also serve as a road map for future crises such as this. Despite so much that is not known about the disease itself, it has become manifestly clear that even less is known about how healthcare systems can contain such a disease."
