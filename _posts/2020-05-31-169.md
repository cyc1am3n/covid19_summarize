summary:
- "Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used molecular diagnostic test for the detection of COVID-19 in biological samples. No universally accepted test is currently available, with several countries adopting different test strategies. The selection of proper location/test site for sample collection is very important to obtain reliable test results. naso- and/or oropharynx swabs (NOS) are the most common test."
