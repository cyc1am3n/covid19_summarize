summary:
- "the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in the consideration of videolaryngoscopy (VL) for tracheal intubation of patients during an outbreak. Benefits of VL include postural advantages, improved view for the laryngoscoscopist and assistants, improved supervision and easier management of unanticipated difficult airways. VL compared with a standard curved Macintosh (MAC) blade are postural benefits."
