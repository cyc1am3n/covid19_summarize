summary:
- "the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the??ACE2 receptor as the entry point to the host cells. ARBs/ACEIs which are widely used in elderly patients have??been found to be??associated with overexpression of ACE2. Specific human immunoglobulin can be tried for COVID-19 patients with critical conditions under supervision. Elderly patients are having high mortality rates compared to younger patients. The virus is used to reduce the severity of the infection."

- "Elderly patients are having high mortality rates from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to younger patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the??ACE2 receptor as the entry point to the host cells. ARBs/ACEIs which are widely used in elderly patients, have??been found to be??associated with overexpression of ACE2.To decrease the severity of COVID-19 infection, ARB/ACEI should be switched to another class drug not known to cause a rise in ACE2 until the COVID-19 infection subsides. Specific human immunoglobulin can be tried for COVID-19 patients with critical conditions under supervision."
