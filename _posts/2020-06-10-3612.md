summary:
- "the current pandemic impacts on the duration of radiotherapy if patients under treatments and synchronously suffering from COVID-19. The models used to compensate the total dose in case of temporary treatment interruption are well known but it is of importance to update and homogenize clinical practice in order to improve local control without increasing normal tissue complications. Overall treatment time is an important factor of local recurrence and indirectly of distant evolution, namely in cases of protracted treatments. Pandemic affects on radiotherapy duration if treatment interruptions are not known but is a factor in local. if. the current. current treatment interruption."
