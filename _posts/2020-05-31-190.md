summary:
- "Auto dock vina was used to screen potential drugs by molecular docking. Ribavirin, remdesivir, chloroquine and luteolin were all studied. Honeysuckle is generally believed to have antiviral effect in traditional Chinese medicine. Chloroquin, chloriquine, luteoolin, can bind to main protease of SARS-CoV-2."

original:
- "In the current episode of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, antiviral drug discovery is of great importance. Auto dock vina was used to screen potential drugs by molecular docking with the structure protein and non-structure protein sites of new coronavirus. Ribavirin, a common antiviral drug, as well as remdesivir, chloroquine and luteolin, were all studied. Honeysuckle is generally believed to have antiviral effect in traditional Chinese medicine, the main flavonoid in which is Luteolin. In the study, it was found luteolin could bind to the same sites of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 as the control molecular with a high affinity. Chloroquine, was proved clinically effective, can bind to the main protease, which may be the possible antiviral mechanism. And the study was restricted to molecular docking without validation by MD simulations. Interactions with the main protease may play a key role in in fighting against viruses. Luteolin is a potential antiviral molecule worthy of attention."
