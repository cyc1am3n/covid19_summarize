summary:
- "angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the new Corona virus causing the serious epidemic COVID-19. The ACE2-B(0)AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the Collectrin-like domain (CLD) of ACE2 mediating homo-dimerization."

original:
- "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the serious epidemic COVID-19. Here we present cryo-EM structures of full-length human ACE2, in the presence of a neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT1, with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 A, with a local resolution of 3.5 A at the ACE2-RBD interface. The ACE2-B(0)AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the Collectrin-like domain (CLD) of ACE2 mediating homo-dimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. These findings provide important insights to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection."
