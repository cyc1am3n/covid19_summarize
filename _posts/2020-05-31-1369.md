summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause neurological complications. We provide a brief overview of these recent observations and discuss some of their possible implications. Given the global dimension of the current pandemic, we highlight the need to consider the possible long-term impact of COVID-19, potentially including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. The current Pandemic is expected to take place in the next few weeks."

original:
- "Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause neurological complications. We provide a brief overview of these recent observations and discuss some of their possible implications. In particular, given the global dimension of the current pandemic, we highlight the need to consider the possible long-term impact of COVID-19, potentially including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders."
