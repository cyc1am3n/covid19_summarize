summary:
- "the first case of a SARS-Cov-2 virus infection was confirmed in Munich on January 27th. Plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients. This manuscript provides an insight into the current situation, which might undergo changes due to the swift progression of the pandemia."

This article aims to provide an overview over the latest developments and insights that affect plastic and hand surgeons. At the same time plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients.
