summary:
- "HM is a non-malignant form of gestational trophoblastic diseases. Most cases were primigravidae with no other known risk factors for HM. In March 2020, the World Health Organization considered coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a worldwide pandemic. Hydatidiform mole (HM) is characterized by failure of fetal development and over proliferation of the trophocytes."

original:
- "In March 2020, the World Health Organization considered coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a worldwide pandemic.(1) Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a non-malignant form of gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTDs) characterized by failure of fetal development and over proliferation of the trophoblasts.(2) In our tertiary care Obstetric hospital, we observed a rising incidence of cases diagnosed with HM in synchronization with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Most of cases were primigravidae with no other known risk factors for HM. We tried to put possible explanations for this condition based on the immunological and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 disease."
