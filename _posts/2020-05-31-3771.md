summary:
- "Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that blocks viral replication, is currently under trial for the treatment of COVID-19. The disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown in vitro efficacy in mice against two coronaviruses responsible for previous respiratory disease outbreaks. In vitro and in vivo effectiveness in mice is shown in GS-5734."
