summary:
- "94-year-old man with well-controlled schizoaffective disorder presented with non-specific symptoms. He was given antibiotics for infection of unknown source. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated with oxygen desaturation and tachypnoea. A postmortem throat swab identified COVID-19 infection. This has implications for screening, assessment and isolation of frail older people. It highlights the potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients."

original:
- "Common symptoms of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever and cough. We describe a 94-year-old man with well-controlled schizoaffective disorder, who presented with non-specific and atypical symptoms: delirium, low-grade pyrexia and abdominal pain. He was given antibiotics for infection of unknown source, subsequently refined to treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated with oxygen desaturation and tachypnoea. A repeat chest X-ray showed widespread opacification. A postmortem throat swab identified COVID-19 infection. He was treated in three wards over 5 days with no infection control precautions. This has implications for the screening, assessment and isolation of frail older people to COVID-specific clinical facilities and highlights the potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients."
