summary:
- "Several health workers have been infected in different countries. Lung ultrasound allowed the identification of nCoV-19 infection at bed-side. lung ultrasound can have several advantages, such as reduced health worker exposition to patients, repeatability during follow-up, low-costs and easier application in low-resource settings. An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease-19 infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and now involved the whole word."

original:
- "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease-19 (nCoV-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and now involved the whole word. Several health workers have been infected in different countries. We report the case of a young man with documented nCoV-19 infection evaluated with lung ultrasound and discuss potential applications of lung ultrasound in this setting. Lung ultrasound allowed the identification of nCoV-19 infection at bed-side. Moreover, lung ultrasound can have several other advantages, such as reduced health worker exposition to infected patients, repeatability during follow-up, low-costs and easier application in low-resource settings."
