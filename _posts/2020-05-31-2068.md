summary:
- "the problem is enormously underestimated, explains the author. Your profession as a health worker can risk taking your life. The problem is unthinkable, the author says. Hospital managers and administrators ask healthcare professionals not to talk about the problem. CoViD-19 is a shortage of personal protective equipment. It exposes doctors and nurses to the risk of being infected by the disease. In this way, healthcare professionals ask them not to speak about the issue."
