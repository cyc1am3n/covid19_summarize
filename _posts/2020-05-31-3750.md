summary:
- "the effect of host immune status on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We report the first case of COVID-19 with HIV-1 and HCV co-infection. This case highlights the influence of HIV-1-induced immune dysfunction on early clearance. HCV-induced immunity status on the early clearance of SARS. The first case showed a persistently negative RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma. Here, we report a case of HCV and HIV-1."
