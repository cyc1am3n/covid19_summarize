summary:
- "a recent study in China showed that transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. This is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is quantified. Here we showed that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. To best our knowledge, this is the. first time that relative transmission of the relative transmission. of the COVID-19 cases was quantified in China."
