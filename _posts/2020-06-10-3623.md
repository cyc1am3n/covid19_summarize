summary:
- "we investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China. Data indicated that indirect transmission occurred resulting from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons. The causative virus may have been transmitted from common objects or aerosolized in confined spaces. This may be due to a virus infection of a common object or a diseased person."

original:
- "To determine possible modes of virus transmission, we investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China. Data indicated that indirect transmission of the causative virus occurred, perhaps resulting from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons."
