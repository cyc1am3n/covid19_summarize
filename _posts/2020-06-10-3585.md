summary:
- "2 species-independent protein-based assays can block virus receptor-binding or sialic acid-attachment. Antibody levels measured correlated strongly with virus-neutralizing antibody titers. We validated the assay for serologic confirmatory diagnosis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus functional antibodies. The antibodies can block viruses receptor binding or binding. They can block a virus receptor binding antibody. This is proving their use for confirming the diagnosis."

original:
- "We developed and validated 2 species-independent protein-based assays to detect Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus functional antibodies that can block virus receptor-binding or sialic acid-attachment. Antibody levels measured in both assays correlated strongly with virus-neutralizing antibody titers, proving their use for serologic confirmatory diagnosis of Middle East respiratory syndrome."
