summary:
- "the control of outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered into a critical period in China. Recent work resumption and public place is planning to open outside of Hubei. Few days ago, we conducted a study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections. Screening among the high-risk population and improving the sensitivity of measurement may contribute to the detection and management of the infection."

original:
- "To date, the controlling of outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered into a critical period in China. Recently, work resumption and public place is planning to open outside of Hubei, suggesting an uncertain and complex development of the epidemic in the next stage. Few days ago, we conducted a study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections of COVID-19, and found them might be the infection source. We believe that the findings are critical for developing public health intervention strategies for controlling COVID-19 infection in the future. Screening among the high-risk population and improving the sensitivity of measurement may contribute to the detection and management of asymptomatic infection."
