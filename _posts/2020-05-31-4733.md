summary:
- "COVID-19 where Co stand for corona, VI stands for virus, and D denotes disease. The future emergence of dangerous viruses will have strong, and possibly unanticipated consequences and impact on the present and future use of cellular therapies. In this commentary we offer a dispassionate assessment of where we believe the dangers will compromise successful cell transplantation. We offer an assessment of the ways in which the future viruses might compromise cell transplants."

original:
- "COVID-19 where Co stand for corona, VI stands for virus, and D denotes disease and was in the recent past referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, has impacted numerous lives and businesses, and has led to a surreal emergency state within world communities. COVID-19 and the future emergence of dangerous viruses will have strong, and as yet possibly unanticipated consequences and impact on the present and future use of cellular therapies. In this commentary we offer a dispassionate assessment of where we believe COVID-19, as well as future emerging viruses might compromise successful cell transplantation."
