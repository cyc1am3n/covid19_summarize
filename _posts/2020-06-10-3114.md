summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging modern radiation oncology. University Hospitals have a mandate to offer high-end treatments to all cancer patients. In times of crisis we must learn to prioritize resources, especially personnel. Communication with our neighboring countries, within societies and between departments can help meet the challenge. We report on our learning system and preparation measures to effectively tackle the challenge in University-Based Radiation Oncology Departments. All measures must be taken with great caution."

However, in times of crisis we must learn to prioritize resources, especially personnel. Compromising oncological outcome will blur all statistics, therefore all measures must be taken with great caution. Communication with our neighboring countries, within societies and between departments can help meet the challenge. Here, we report on our learning system and preparation measures to effectively tackle the COVID-19 challenge in University-Based Radiation Oncology Departments."
