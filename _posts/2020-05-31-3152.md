summary:
- "the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients from February 5, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none became severe. The designated hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital. It includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals."

METHODS: Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. RESULTS: From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period). Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe. There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19. Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully. After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals. Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic."
