summary:
- "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged since December 2019 in Wuhan city. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective. ECMO may be also an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. The study described and discussed the clinical outcomes of the treatment for ARDS patients. There are indications of use for severe COV-19 in China, and some important issues associated with the treatment."

original:
- "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged since December 2019 in Wuhan city, and has quickly spread throughout China and other countries. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to World Health Organization (WHO), management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. Given to the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may be also an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this study, we described and discussed the clinical outcomes of ECMO for ARDS patients, ECMO use for severe COVID-19 in China, the indications of ECMO use, and some important issues associated with ECMO."
