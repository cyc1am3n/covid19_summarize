summary:
- "World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. The aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed patients. This paper will provide guidance regarding disposable protective gear to be used, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment. In addition, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals.

- "Objectives From December 2019, a novel coronavirus named COVID-19 was reported in China. Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Key Findings The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. Conclusion In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment."
