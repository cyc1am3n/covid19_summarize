Chest computed tomography (CT) showed different abnormalities from conventional COVID19. The faster absorption of pulmonary lesions also highlights the importance of antiretroviral therapy in this patient. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

- "In December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Since then, this disease has infected more than 900,000 individuals worldwide. Here we report a case of non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia who was living with HIV. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed different abnormalities from those of conventional COVID-19, and the faster absorption of pulmonary lesions also highlights the importance of antiretroviral therapy in this patient. This report provides reference for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
