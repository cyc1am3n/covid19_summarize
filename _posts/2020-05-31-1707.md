In this article, we will detail our approach on how to perform interventions for patients at the bedside in the isolation room and with the patient transferred to the interventional radiology centre. The workflows have been developed in conjunction with multiple other stakeholders within our hospital, drawing from valuable lessons we have learned from the SARS outbreak of 2003.

As it is uncertain when the pandemic will be controlled, it is crucial for procedurists of all stripes to be familiar and confident in performing procedures for COVID-19 patients to prevent intra-hospital infection.
