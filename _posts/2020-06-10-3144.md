summary:
- "screened a panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Some drug candidates showed very low micromolar IC50s. niclosamide and ciclesonide were notable in some aspects. Drug repositioning is the only feasible option to address the COVID-19 global challenge immediately. We identified 24 potential antiviral drug candidates. The panel was pre-selected by an assay of SARS. CoV-2 infection."

We screened a panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 which were pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV and identified 24 potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some drug candidates showed very low micromolar IC50s and in particular, two FDA-approved drugs - niclosamide and ciclesonide - were notable in some respects."
