summary:
- "the case highlights possible co-detection of known respiratory viruses. We noted low sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2, which could further complicate recognition of the full extent of disease. The case highlights co-infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A virus in a patient with pneumonia in China. Case highlights possible collaboration of known virus. It could also complicate the recognition of disease's full extent."
