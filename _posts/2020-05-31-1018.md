summary:
- "the need for widespread availability of accurate and efficient diagnostic testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral antibodies in infected individuals. This report describes various assay techniques and tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. Most tests for early detection rely on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays are promising alternatives. Identification of individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus requires serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA and a wide range of accurate diagnostic testing. The need for accurate and effective diagnostic tests. RNA detection and detection."

original:
- "An ongoing theme of the COVID-19 pandemic is the need for widespread availability of accurate and efficient diagnostic testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral antibodies in infected individuals. This report describes various assay techniques and tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. Most tests for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA rely on the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays, including transcription-mediated amplification and CRISPR-based methodologies, are promising alternatives. Identification of individuals who have developed antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay. This report also provides an overview of current development in COVID-19 diagnostic techniques and products to facilitate future improvement and innovation."
