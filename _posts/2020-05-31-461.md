summary:
- "RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing. To this end, systematic testing of large population groups is mandatory. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Copyright holder is a copyrighted author. SARS- CoV-2 vaccine is banned in the U.S. Until an effective vaccine is available. It is essential to prevent resurgence in contagion. Systematic tests of large populations by RT PCR are mandatory to cases identification and re-PCR reducing the likelihood of case identification."

To this end, systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing thereby minimizing the likelihood of resurgence in contagion.(1) This article is protected by copyright.
