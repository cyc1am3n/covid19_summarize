original:
- "Two Vietnamese adults returned to their home province of Vinh Phuc in northern Vietnam on Jan 17, 2020, from Wuhan, China, where they had been living since Nov 15, 2019, for a business trip. They presented with mild respiratory symptoms to their local health facilities at 4 days and 8 days, respectively, after arrival in Vinh Phuc. Both individuals were initially placed into respiratory isolation in hospital. Case 1 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on Jan 30, 2020, and remained in isolation until recovery. Case 2 was discharged from isolation in hospital after having one negative test result on Jan 28 (11 days after returning from Wuhan). Following discharge, the patient attended a family social function. 2 days later, she was readmitted after a second nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken during her time in hospital was reported as positive. Screening of 79 individuals who had been in contact with these two patients (namely, family members in the same household and anyone who had been within 2 m of them) was initiated on Jan 31. Six individuals from the same work team, who had also travelled from Wuhan on Jan 17, were isolated, and four of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3, 4, and 8 in Vinh Phuc, and one case from another province). Five secondary cases were diagnosed within the social network of case 2. These included three household members (cases 6, 7, and 11) and two people who had attended the social function (cases 5 and 9; appendix p 1). Four of these individuals reported mild respiratory symptoms; the remaining patient was asymptomatic (case 7) at the time of diagnosis."
