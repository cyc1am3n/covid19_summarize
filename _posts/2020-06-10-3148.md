original:
- "Since its emergence in December 2019, it took only a couple of months for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This along with the highly infectious nature of the disease and the associated mortality call for particular attention to the underlying (immuno)pathomechanism(s). The latter will inform case management and vaccine design. Unravelling these mechanisms can assist basic scientists, laboratory medicine practitioners, clinicians, public health practitioners, funding agencies, and health care policymakers in responding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic."
