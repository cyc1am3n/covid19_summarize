summary:
- "vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation. All five full-term births exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion. Vascular Complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative."

original:
- "COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is increasingly being recognized as a systemic thrombotic and microvascular injury syndrome that may have its roots in complement activation. We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients, making up the entirety of such deliveries at our hospital. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by very focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular Complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation."
