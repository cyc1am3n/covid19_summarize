title: "Generalized Pustular Figurate Erythema A Newly Delineated Severe Cutaneous Drug Reaction Linked with Hydroxychloroquine"

summary:
- "severe cutaneous drug reaction resembling acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been documented. It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration. Special recognition of this entity is pivotal."

original:
- "A severe cutaneous drug reaction resembling acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis resulting from ingestion of hydroxychloroquine has been documented. It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration. Given the anticipated surge in the use of hydroxychloroquine due to its reported benefits in those with coronavirus-19 infection, specific recognition of this entity is pivotal. We delineate it as generalized pustular figurate erythema (GPFE). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
