summary:
- "Almost all dental procedures generate aerosols, from the 3-in-1 used during an examination, to the high-speed handpiece and the aspirator. The concept of 'universal precautions' is now more so than ever before our current environment exemplifies this. It is not appropriate at this time to ask the question: 'how will COVID-19 impact on future dental care provision?' The dental community can begin to think about the problem and thus devise a strategy to manage the future. I feel it is possible to produce aerosol - from the 3 in-1 used in an examination to the handpiece."

I feel it is appropriate to raise the topic early so that the dental community can begin to think about the problem and thus devise a strategy to manage the future. Almost all dental procedures generate aerosols, from the 3-in-1 used during an examination, to the high-speed handpiece and the aspirator. We are all familiar with the concept of 'universal precautions' whereby in the past we have assumed that every individual is a source of potential cross infection, now more so than ever before our current environment exemplifies this.
