summary:
- "retrospective analysis was performed on 217 COVID-19 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020 to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of hospital information system. Risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the WHO-UMC system and the prevalence of the disease was 37.8% in the patients."

original:
- "To evaluate the incidence, type and risk factors associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among COVID-19 patients by Hospital Pharmacovigilance System (CHPS). A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 COVID-19 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020 to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the WHO-UMC system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8% ). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. 96.8% of ADRs occurred within 14 days of hospitalization. Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (OR: 2.02, [95% CI: 1.03-3.96], P=0.04), number of drugs used in hospital (OR: 3.17, [95%CI: 1.60-6.27], P=0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR:2.07, [95%CI: 1.02-4.23], P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients. Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period. Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in clinic."
