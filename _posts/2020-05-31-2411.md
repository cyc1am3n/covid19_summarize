Here we present a set of recommendations on the performance of the procedure during a virtual webinar on March 24, 2020.

original:
- "Flexible laryngoscopy, the gold-standard evaluation of the larynx and the pharynx, is one of the most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, flexible laryngoscopy represents a risk for patients and an occupational hazard for otolaryngologists and any clinic staff involved with the procedure or endoscope reprocessing. Here we present a set of recommendations on flexible laryngoscopy performance during the pandemic, including patient selection, personal protective equipment, and endoscope disinfection, based on a consensus reached during a virtual webinar on March 24, 2020, attended by approximately 300 participants from the American laryngology community."
