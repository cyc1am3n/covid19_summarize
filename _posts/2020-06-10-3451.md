summary:
- "the poor, including refugees and migrant workers staying in fragile conditions, are most vulnerable. An outbreak of COVID-19 in a place where the concept of physical distancing is next to impossible could easily overwhelm the public health system. It is therefore essential to understand the consequences of being exposed to biomass smoke. The poor are particularly vulnerable to the outbreak. Using biomass smoke is likely to be a factor in carbon dioxide emissions. This is due to the fact that biomass smoke can be exposed to the disease."

original:
- "Evidence supports the link between air pollution and COVID-19 and thus it is likely that exposure to biomass smoke is associated with COVID-19. The poor, including refugees and migrant workers staying in fragile conditions, are most vulnerable. An outbreak of COVID-19 in a place where the concept of physical distancing is next to impossible could easily overwhelm the public health system. It is thus essential to understand the consequences of being exposed to smoke in relation to COVID-19 infection."
