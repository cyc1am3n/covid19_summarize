summary:
- "Covid-19 treatments can be analysed according to validated methodological standards. The different drugs tested in current clinical trials are already widely prescribed to patients by doctors in hospitals. They can therefore be immediately analysed based on validated methods. This could make it possible to decide on the efficacy and safety of Covid19 treatments by avoiding the pitfalls of preliminary studies and randomized clinical trials. Comparison of real-life data from hospital information systems could make possible. randomized trials and preliminary studies could be avoided."
