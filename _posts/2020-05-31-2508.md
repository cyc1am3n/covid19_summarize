summary:
- "in severe cases of COVID 19 complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, acute kidney failure, sepsis and septic shock can occur along with complications associated with prolonged hospitalization. In severe patients with these complications, corticosteroids have been used widely (2,3,4) in severe patients. One patient group was intravenously administered methylprednisolone at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/d for five to seven days. There appeared to be some evidence of COV 19 complications,. respiratory distress.. syndrome, cardiac."

original:
- "Although there appeared to be some evidence of corticosteroid use in people with severe disease requiring hospitalization, contradictory evidence by WHO regarding corticosteroid use in some viral illnesses suggest that this evidence is not definitive. In severe cases of COVID 19 complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, acute kidney failure, sepsis and septic shock can occur along with complications associated with prolonged hospitalization such as superimposed bacterial infections. In severe patients with these complications, corticosteroids have been used widely (2,3,4). During a retrospective review in Wuhan Union Hospital (5), the efficacy of early use of short term corticosteroid was demonstrated and compared with a control group using the clinical picture and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. One amongst the patient groups was intravenously administered methylprednisolone at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/d for five to seven days. The results indicated that the rapid return of body temperature to a normal, improvement in SpO2 was seen within the group that was given corticosteroid. Chest CT showed improved absorption focus with methylprednisolone administration. Parallel to the reported observation, another Chinese study, showed similar outcomes with early use of high dose corticosteroids along with quinolone in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (6)."
