summary:
- "COVID-19 spread rapidly from China, reaching a pandemic and putting the world on alert. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 211 countries, areas or territories. In India, 5000 patients were confirmed with SARS CoV-2, with an estimated mortality risk of 2.5% and an escalating incidence rate increasing daily. There are no specific vaccines or treatments for the disease at this time, and current management includes travel restrictions, patient isolation, and supportive medical care. Scientists are a novel infectious disease caused by a newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by a newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. COVID-19 spread rapidly from China, reaching a pandemic and putting the world on alert. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 211 countries, areas or territories, and >1,200,000 cases have been confirmed, with an estimated mortality risk of ~5.5% (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). In India, ~5000 patients were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2, with an estimated mortality risk of ~2.5% and an escalating incidence rate increasing daily. Unfortunately, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 at this time, and current management includes travel restrictions, patient isolation, and supportive medical care. However, scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, but a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology is required."
