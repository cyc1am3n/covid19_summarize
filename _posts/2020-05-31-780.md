original:
- "The setting is a rural district hospital in Yala province, the southernmost province of Thailand that shares an international border with Malaysia, another country where COVID-19 outbreaks occur. The setting is a small 30-bed hospital that serves local people in that rural district. The outbreak occurred on 22th March 2020. Three medical personnel (2 nurses and 1 physician) developed fever and had confirmed COVID-19 after providing regular care to local people who had a history of COVID-19 contact. All three medical personnel are presently under respiratory isolation, but no one has had lung complications. All the other 21 medical personnel of the hospital, including 7 physicians, are under quarantine. The hospital had to be closed and could not provide any service. According to our best knowledge, this is the first report of COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital that resulted in total disruption of hospital function. The COVID-19 outbreak in hospitals is considered serious since it can result in abrupt cessation of local medical care and especially for management of COVID-19 during the outbreak. Hospitals usually have protective systems in place, but the high volume load might result in unsuccessful disease control."
