summary:
- "VV-ECMO is one of the ultimate treatments for acute respiratory failure. The effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unknown. In Japan, centralization of patients has not been sufficient. We suggest nationwide centralization and further research to respond to the crisis caused by COVID19. On day 12, she was weaned off ECCO on day 12. She was a passenger of a cruise ship and tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."

original:
- "Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is one of the ultimate treatments for acute respiratory failure. However, the effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unknown. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old woman who was a passenger of a cruise ship tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while in quarantine on board using throat swab. Three days after admission, her condition deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated. On day 6, VV-ECMO was introduced. Lopinavir/ritonavir was given; continuous renal replacement therapy was also introduced. On day 10, her chest radiography and lung compliance improved. She was weaned off ECMO on day 12. Conclusion: Treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID-19 by ECMO should recognize lung plasticity considering time to ECMO introduction and interstitial biomarkers. In Japan, centralization of ECMO patients has not been sufficient. Thus, we suggest nationwide centralization and further research to respond to the crisis caused by COVID-19."
