summary:
- "this article examines three aspects of antivirals as they might relate to the treatment of COVID-19. The article looks at the treatment and treatment of vaporization. It examines the use of a marine natural product extract as opposed to a single molecule as an antiviral agent."

original:
- "This article examines three aspects of antivirals as they might relate to the treatment of COVID-19: (i) the use of vaporization for the delivery of antivirals, with the bulk constituents having mild antiviral efficacy; (ii) the application of a marine natural product extract as opposed to a single molecule as an antiviral agent; and (iii) a counter intuitive approach to formulation that is, in part, based on delivering multiple species that fall into three categories: building blocks for the virus to accelerate replication; an energy source for the infected cell to boast its immune response; and the species that antagonize or provide toxicity to the virus."
