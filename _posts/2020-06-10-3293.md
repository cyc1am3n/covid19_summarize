summary:
- "Type 1 interferons have a broad antiviral activity in vitro. They are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat MERS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss preliminary data concerning the potential activity of type 1. We discuss the relevance of evaluating these molecules in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19."
