summary:
- "Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods. Capacity of methods is limited by requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. We developed and evaluated assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactivity of RT lAMP assay to other human Coronaviruses was not observed."

- "Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput."
