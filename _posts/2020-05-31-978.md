summary:
- "two independent in vitro studies indicated that favipiravir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. Data from the authors? group suggests an EC50 value in the range 40-80 ??g/mL. Eloy P., et al, agrees with authors' assumption."

original:
- "We appreciate the letter by Eloy P., et al for their comments and complement regarding our review1-2. Two independent in vitro studies indicated that favipiravir (T-705) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with EC50 values of 61.88 ?M (9.4 ?g/mL)3 and >100 ?M (15.7 ?g/mL)4, respectively. Data from the authors? group suggests an EC50 value in the range 40-80 ??g/mL (X. de Lamballerie & F. Touret, unpublished results). I agree with the authors? assumption that favipiravir shows similar EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV. As favipiravir is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation through ribosylation and phosphorylation in the host cells to form its triphosphate form (favipiravir-RTP), we think that variation in favipiravir activation by the cultured cells may, at least partially, contribute to the difference in the in vitro EC50 among studies."
