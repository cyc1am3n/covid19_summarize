summary:
- "Observation suggests androgen expression might be clue to COVID-19 severity. Observations suggest androgin expression may be a clue to severity of the disease. A preliminary observation suggests that androgent expression might help. The findings suggest that rogens may be clues to severity in the study. CoVID19 patients may have a high frequency of male pattern hair loss. It suggests that the expression of arogen might be an indication."
