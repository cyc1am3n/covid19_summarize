summary:
- "Chloroquine and closely related structural analogs employed initially for malaria are now gaining worldwide attention due to the rapidly spreading pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus disease (COVID) of 2019. The hard efficacy data have been limited thus far. This review aims to present the available in vitro and clinical data for the role of chloroquin/hydroxychloroquiine in COVID-19. It attempts to put them into perspective, especially relating to the different risks/benefits in the treatment of malaria has been employed for the treatment gaining global attention."

original:
- "Chloroquine and closely related structural analogs, employed initially for the treatment of malaria, are now gaining worldwide attention due to the rapidly spreading pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, named coronavirus disease (COVID) of 2019 (COVID-19). Although much of this attention has a mechanistic basis, the hard efficacy data for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the management of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 have been limited thus far. This review aims to present the available in vitro and clinical data for the role of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 and attempts to put them into perspective, especially in relation to the different risks/benefits particular to each patient who may require treatment."
