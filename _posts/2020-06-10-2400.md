summary:
- "the large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children. This limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens."

original:
- "The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children."
