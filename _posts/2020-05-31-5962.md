summary:
- "cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to rapid development and available data. The likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. It is imperative emergency clinicians understand preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease and understand proposed treatment modalities. Since its emergence, cases are found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China."

original:
- "A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causing acute illness with severe symptoms has been isolated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities."
