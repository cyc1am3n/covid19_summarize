summary:
- "the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. Electronic medical records of 11 patients were collected and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses."

We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic."
