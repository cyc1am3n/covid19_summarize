summary:
- "ECMO is a resource-intensive therapy that can be considered in highly selected patients. Expert centers should employ an evidence-based ARDS treatment algorithm and a multidisciplinary approach. Caring for patients requires adequate infection control and safety precautions for healthcare workers. The treatment is aimed at refractory respiratory and cardiac failure. It is recommended upon failure of conventional therapy. Infection control is essential."
