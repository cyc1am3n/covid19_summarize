summary:
- "beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks since 2002. SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-coV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS CoV-2 in late 2019. Here, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS. We found that SARS coV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralizations."

original:
- "Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2."
