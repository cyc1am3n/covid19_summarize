summary:
- "early findings suggest a remarkably high proportion of asymptomatic (12%) and presymptomatic (30%) cases in Brunei. This proportion was even higher in imported cases. These have implications for measures to prevent onward local transmission and should prompt reconsideration of current testing protocols and safe de-escalation of social distancing measures. We report early findings from COVID-19 cases suggesting a relatively high proportion. The proportion was higher in import cases compared to imported cases in imports."
