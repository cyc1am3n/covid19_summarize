summary:
- "the oligonucleotide research community is uniquely positioned to apply its technology and expertise to combat this growing viral pandemic. The global health emergency involving the emergence and rapid spread of a novel coronavirus has prompted the world scientific community to consider how it can help. With few safe and effective drugs available to combat the threat to humanity and the normal functioning of our society, the research community has a capacity for rational drug design, swift development cycles, and pursuing targets undruggable by conventional treatment strategies have been developed to fight the global health crisis has been able to use its technology to help combat the crisis."
