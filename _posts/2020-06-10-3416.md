summary:
- "Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged public health care systems globally. Cardiological Society of India (CSI) has ventured in this moment of crisis to evolve a consensus document for care of acute MI. This care should be individualized, based on local expertise and governmental advisories. During COVID, management of cardiovascular emergencies like acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) may be compromised. Coronavirus disease-19 is a rapidly spreading disease. India has initiated a nationwide lockdown to prevent the exponential surge of cases. Pandemic. In the past decade has challenged health care."
