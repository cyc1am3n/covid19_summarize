summary:
- "an in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome. A systematic comparison identified 380 amino acid substitutions. The new genome may have caused functional and pathogenic divergence. 380 substitutions have been identified. This may have been caused by SARS or SARS-like coronanaviruses, which may have led to a functional divergency of the genome. An annotation of a new genome has uncovered differences between coron reveals 380. genome reveals differences between."
