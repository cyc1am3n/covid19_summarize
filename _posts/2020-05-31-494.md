summary:
- "Nucleic acid amplification tests are the primary means of identifying acute infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow for rapid therapeutic interventions. Amplification tests (NAATs) may allow more efficient and fast use of isolation resources. /bold>Background./Bld>Nucleic acids are used to identify acute infections."
