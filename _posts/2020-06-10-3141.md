summary:
- "the impact of dietary patterns and the commensal microbiome on susceptibility to and severity of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus has been ignored to date. The mitigating role of nanotechnology with relation to impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus is highlighted. We present a rationale for an urgent need to investigate this possible impact and therapeutic options for COVID-19 based on dietary changes."

In this Perspective, we present a rationale for an urgent need to investigate this possible impact and therapeutic options for COVID-19 based on dietary and microbiome modifications. The mitigating role of nanotechnology with relation to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus is highlighted."
