summary:
- "Developed during the first stage of the (inter)national Coronavirus pandemic, my reflections address issues of privilege, emotional labour and the virtual invasion of the home space. The newly enforced flexible work measures based on online tools have turned current work-life dynamics into a ?Neverending Shift?. This paper offers an example of the effects of such unexpected and unprecedented circumstances on personal and professional academic lives."

original:
- "This paper offers a feminist reflection written as a nocturnal stream of consciousness exposing the embodied, emotional and professional experience of living and working during a pandemic outbreak. Framed within a feminist approach, this personal narrative provides and example of the effects of such unexpected and unprecedented circumstances on personal and professional academic lives. Developed during the first stage of the (inter)national Coronavirus pandemic, my reflections address issues of privilege; emotional labour; the virtual invasion of the home space within the current increasingly ambiguous space of ?the workplace?; workload, and wellbeing. Further, I consider how the newly enforced flexible work measures based on online tools have turned current work-life dynamics into a ?Neverending Shift?."
