summary:
- "Dornase alfa degrades extracellular DNA to reduce mucus rigidity and accumulation. It was associated with respiratory improvement in a first patient. We propose a likely contribution to severe COVID-19 morbidity. The NET should be considered for clinical trials in treatment."

original:
- "We propose a likely contribution to severe COVID-19 morbidity by extracellular DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Dornase alfa degrades extracellular DNA to reduce mucus rigidity and accumulation, and was associated with respiratory improvement in a first patient. Dornase alfa should be considered for clinical trials in treatment of severe COVID-19."
