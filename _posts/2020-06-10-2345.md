original:
- "Viral respiratory diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), always pose severe threat to people. First identified in the late December 2019, in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rampantly spread to lots of provinces in China, and multiple countries are affected. The viral outbreaks have stirred panic and emergency on public health around the world and the number of infections continues to rise. But the cause and consequence of the pneumonia still remain unknown. In order to effectively implement the epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis is critical to disease control. Herein we scrutinize a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection."
