summary:
- "diabetes emerged as major risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and adverse outcome in patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hyperglycemia on day-1 is the best predictor of radiographic imaging of SARS-Cov2 regardless of past medical history of diabetes. The role of admission hyperglyce in COVID patients has not been well-explored, yet. Diabetes emerged as a risk factor in severe acute respiration syndrome. Despite this retrospective analysis, we report for the first time as the risk factor. and adverse outcomes in patients. hyperglare."

- "Diabetes emerged as major risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and adverse outcome in patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, the role of admission hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19 has not been well-explored, yet. With this retrospective analysis, we report for the first time that hyperglycemia on day-1 is the best predictor of radiographic imaging of SARS-Cov2, regardless of the past medical history of diabetes. Admission hyperglycemia should not be overlooked, but adequately treated to improve the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with our without diabetes."
