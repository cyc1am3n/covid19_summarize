summary:
- "PCR protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) include 2-3 targets for detection. We developed a triplex, real-time reverse transcription PCR. This could streamline detection and decrease reagent use during current high testing demands. Most reverse transcription protocols include 2-3 target targets. The protocol could reduce detection compared with singleplex assays. PCR could reduce use during high SARS-coV-2 tests."

We developed a triplex, real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 that maintained clinical performance compared with singleplex assays. This protocol could streamline detection and decrease reagent use during current high SARS-CoV-2 testing demands."
