summary:
- "Using reported case data up to 31 January 2020, we define the number of unreported cases. We then use the model to project the epidemic forward with varying levels of public health interventions. Model predictions emphasize importance of major public health intervention in controlling COVID-19 epidemics. The model predicts the importance of public interventions in controlling the epidemics in Wuhan, China. Using the parameterized model, we identify number of cases and then use it to project epidemic forward. Figures highlight importance of varying public health. case data from the. January 2020 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Reported case data."

original:
- "We develop a mathematical model to provide epidemic predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China. We use reported case data up to 31 January 2020 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission to parameterize the model. From the parameterized model, we identify the number of unreported cases. We then use the model to project the epidemic forward with varying levels of public health interventions. The model predictions emphasize the importance of major public health interventions in controlling COVID-19 epidemics."
