summary:
- "wastewater testing could also be used as an early-warning sign if the virus returns. More than a dozen research groups have started analysing wastewater for the new coronavirus as a way to estimate the total number of infections in a community. The method could be used to detect the virus if it returns to communities, say scientists. So far, researchers have found traces of the virus in the Netherlands, the United States and Sweden."

More than a dozen research groups worldwide have started analysing wastewater for the new coronavirus as a way to estimate the total number of infections in a community, given that most people will not be tested. The method could also be used to detect the coronavirus if it returns to communities, say scientists. So far, researchers have found traces of the virus in the Netherlands, the United States and Sweden."
