A standardized set of scenarios/questions and responses are pre-determined and candidates rotate through various stations to meet examiners in face-to-face, in-person, mini-interviews during a finite time allotment. The objective of MMIs are to generally to assess candidates' characteristics in different domains such as ethics and morality, communication skills, and critical thinking. MMIs can be reliable and feasible, moreso than traditional interview methods."
