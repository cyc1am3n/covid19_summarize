summary:
- "Three countries and sovereignties have managed COVID-19 remarkably well. These countries have made tests widely available and accessible and carried out rigorous contact tracing. Ministers have also been warning about the impending outbreak and relaying accurate information round the clock. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan enjoy a reassuring sense of social calm and security. Three countries currently face sharp increases of new cases each day. One critical difference in initial approach was the overall sense of complacency by government officials."

original:
- "Three countries and sovereignties that have managed COVID-19 remarkably well (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan) happen to be densely populated regions that frequently inter-travel with mainland China, which makes their achievement noteworthy. Since the inception of COVID-19, these countries have made tests widely available and accessible and carried out rigorous contact tracing, thus facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of every case. Ministers have also been warning about the impending outbreak and relaying accurate information round the clock. While initially creating much panic, these efforts resulted in a perpetual minimal relative number of new cases over the past few months (Fig. 1). Today, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan enjoy a reassuring sense of social calm and security. By contrast, three countries that currently face sharp increases of new cases each day (Italy, Spain, U.S.) (Fig. 1) either delayed or lacked sufficient access to reliable testing for varying reasons. One critical difference in initial approach was the overall sense of complacency by government officials, resulting in a reactive instead of proactive response. Italy, Spain, and the U.S chose to reassure the populace and downplayed the threat of COVID-19."
