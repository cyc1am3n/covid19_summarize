summary:
- "Compared to N95 respirators, the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25;??I2=0%; low certainty in the evidence) Only one trial evaluated coronatees separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49). Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence."

- "Background Respiratory protective devices are critical in protecting against infection in health care workers at high risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID-19 are limited. Purpose To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in health care workers. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from January 1st??2014 to March 9th 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1st??1990 to December 9th??2014. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in health care workers. Data Extraction Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Data Synthesis Four RCTs were meta-analysed adjusting for clustering. Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25;??I2=0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28;??I2=78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49). Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. Conclusions Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health care workers during non-aerosol generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply."
