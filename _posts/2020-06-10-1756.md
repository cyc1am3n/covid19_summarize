The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit. Performing a Chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease. The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc. The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.
