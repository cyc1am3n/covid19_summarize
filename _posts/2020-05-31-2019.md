summary:
- "Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) is not a common presentation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) Current studies suggest that conjunctivitis is not common presentation. Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctional swabs in humans. ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID19 also raised concern on ocular transmission. Personal protective equipment should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes. Current studies have reported the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus disease."

original:
- "Although current studies suggested that conjunctivitis is not a common presentation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), several studies have reported the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) in ocular secretions. Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV. However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs. In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles. Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission. As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis."
