summary:
- "tracheostomy is an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers. Patients with COVID-19 have a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation. This is because of the infectious nature of the virus. We look back at previous data from SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure."

original:
- "Patients who become severely ill from COVID-19 have a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation, making tracheostomy a likely consideration. The infectious nature of COVID-19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration. We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19, and look back at previous data from SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID-19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy. If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure. Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced PPE where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.
