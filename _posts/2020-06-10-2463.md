summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to have a more benign evolution in children. Low susceptibility and minor aggressivity have been highlighted in most cases. There are currently no effective antiviral drugs treatment for the affected kids. The aim of this short review is to highlight the differences existing between COVID-19 cases in adults and children in adults. It runs in three major stages: a mild cold-like illness, a moderate respiratory syndrome and a severe acute interstitial pneumonia."

original:
- "OBJECTIVE: The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 greatly involves the resources of the global healthcare system, as it affects newborns, adults, and elders. This infection runs in three major stages: a mild cold-like illness, a moderate respiratory syndrome and a severe acute interstitial pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a more benign evolution in children. As a matter of fact, low susceptibility and minor aggressivity have been highlighted in most cases. There are currently no effective antiviral drugs treatment for the affected children. No sufficient results have been reached by the use of interferon (IFN), lopinavir/ritonavir, orbidol, and oseltamivir in the treatment of the coronaviruses infection. The aim of this short review is to highlight the differences existing between COVID-19 cases in adults and children."
