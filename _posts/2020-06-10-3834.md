summary:
- "a monovalent, parenteral, subunit rotavirus vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults in the USA and in toddlers and infants in South Africa. The vaccine elicited poor responses against heterotypic strains. We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenity of a trivalent vaccine formulation. A trivalent formulation was also immunogenic for toddlers, infants and toddlers in the U.S. and South Africa, but was poorly tolerated in adults. It was well-tolerable monovalent vaccine was a parent, monovalent and subunit in adults, but."
