summary:
- "emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We found that the receptor-binding domains bind with similar affinities to human ACE2. The ectodomain trimer provides a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. SARS mediated entry into cell cells. Cryo-EM structures of a viral virus has led to more than 3,000 deaths and more than 90,000 infection."

original:
- "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2??S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2??S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2??S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We??determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2??S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry.??Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination."
