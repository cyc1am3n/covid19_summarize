summary:
- "the pathogenic coronavirus has been wreaking havoc worldwide since January. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is problematic as no one has prior immunity. Many people with COVID-19 develop mild to moderate symptoms. Some develop profound seemingly unchecked inflammatory responses leading to acute lung injury and hypoxemic respiratory failure, the most common cause for death. No specific antiviral treatments are available."
