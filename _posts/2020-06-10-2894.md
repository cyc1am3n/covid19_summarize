summary:
- "information available on public data included gender, age, cause of death, location city, date of disease onset and date of admission. Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare continuous variables because data was non-normal distribution. Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables because the data number was limited. Information on 24 deceased cases included COVID-19 infection, sudden death, and traffic accident groups. We grouped cases into three groups based on the causes of death."

original:
- "We retrieved information on 24 deceased cases of health workers based on official reports from governmental institutes, as well as reports from news sites. Information available on public data included gender, age, cause of death, location city, date of disease onset, date of admission, date of death, and hospital levels they worked. We grouped cases into three groups based on the cause of death, which included COVID-19 infection, sudden death, and traffic accident groups. Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare continuous variables because the data was non-normal distribution, and Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables because the data number was limited."
