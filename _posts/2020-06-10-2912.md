- "The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need for therapeutics. Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective against various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as an antiviral agent. In this brief article, we summarize the broad antiviral activities of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use for treatment of COVID-19."
