summary:
- "Previous work on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccines identified cellular immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement as potential safety issues. We discuss the implications of these findings for COVID-19 vaccine development and our approach to optimizing for safety and efficacy. Previous work identified antibodies-dependent improvements as potential risks. The findings are based on previous work on SARS-coV vaccines."
