summary:
- "Among 11 patients in Thailand infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 we detected viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. We identified viral co-infections and an asymptomatic person with detectable virus RNA. In serial tests, we describe implications for surveillance. 11 people in Thailand detected virus a median of 14 days after illness onset and 9 days after fever resolution. The virus was detected in the upper respiratory samples of 11 patients."
