summary:
- "Physicists are asked to perform non-essential activities by telecommuting or work-from-home (WFH) in many places. The impact of COVID-19 on the global healthcare systems is unprecedently enormous. As hospitals implement various preventive and control measures to contain the virus, medical physics has encountered unique challenges during this special period in wider aspects from clinical practice, research, administration to education."

Like many other clinical disciplines, medical physics has encountered unique challenges during this special period in wider aspects from clinical practice, research, administration to education. As hospitals implement various preventive and control measures to contain the virus, medical physicists are asked to perform non-essential activities by telecommuting or work-from-home (WFH) in many places."
