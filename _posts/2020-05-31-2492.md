summary:
- "COVID-19 may become a globally heavy burden, especially in the low-income and middle-income countries. The diagnosis, changes, and treatment evaluation of the disease need to be tested to provide an essential basis. Multiple organs such as lung, kidney, liver, and heart will be damaged, and the degree of damage depends on the results of clinical tests."
