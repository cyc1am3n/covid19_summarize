summary:
- "Liver Transplant Programs in Italy have faced a sequela of management and clinical decision-making problems due to the high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) The Italian Society for Organ Transplantation issued a survey to assess the initial impact of this pandemic event on the routine activity of 22 Italian Liver Programs. One hundred percent of participants completed the survey within a few days. The study is presented dividing the centers in two macro-areas: north-central Italy and cadaveric transplants in the country's 22. a series of management problems."

original:
- "Liver Transplant Programs in Italy have faced a sequela of management and clinical decision-making problems due to the high incidence in some regions of the country of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Italian Society for Organ Transplantation (SITO) and the Board of Liver Transplant Program Directors issued a survey to assess the initial impact of this pandemic event on the routine activity of 22 Italian Liver Transplant Programs. One hundred percent of participants completed the survey within a few days. The analysis is presented dividing the centers in two macro-areas: north-central Italy and south-central Italy. The reason for this is that the two areas had a different incidence of the infection and because they have distinctive rates of cadaveric donation. Overall, all centers remained open although a reduction in the activity was noted. Transplant Programs reduced their outpatient activity both in terms of pre-transplant evaluation (68% of the centers) and transplant recipient follow-up (100%); a reduction in transplant activity was observed in the first two weeks of March only in the north-central macro area (23 LTs vs 39 in 2018 and 60 in 2019); overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered for 24 liver transplant recipients and 37 health care providers in liver transplant units. In the perspective of the increasing magnitude of the epidemic, more data will be required to define appropriate strategies for the increasingly complex management of liver transplant patients."
