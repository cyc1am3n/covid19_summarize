summary:
- "doctors and ethicists say priority should go to people with the best chance of recovery, says Klein. If there is a shortage of breathing machines, doctors say priority shouldn't be given to those with best chances of recovery. Alice Klein says it is important to get breathing machines. Klein's report says there are no breathing machines available. She says there should be breathing machines and breathing machines shortages. It's a problem with breathing machines but doctors say it's the best way to recover. Smalle says if there are breathing machines aren't enough to get the best chances."
