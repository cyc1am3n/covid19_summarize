summary:
- "PDCoV N and TGEV N can competitively interact with PEDV N. Whether mixing of viral components during co-infection alters pathogenic outcomes or viral replication is not known. Results from this study give insights into functional compatibilities and evolutionary relationship between CoV viral proteins during viral co- infection and co-evolution. CoV proteins can be replaced in the production of infectious PEDV particles. The presence of PDcoV N significantly suppresses PEDV replication."

original:
- "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) share tropism for swine intestinal epithelial cells. Whether mixing of viral components during co-infection alters pathogenic outcomes or viral replication is not known. In this study, we investigated how different coronavirus nucleocapsid (CoV N) proteins interact and affect PEDV replication. We found that PDCoV N and TGEV N can competitively interact with PEDV N. However, the presence of PDCoV or TGEV N led to very different outcomes on PEDV replication. While PDCoV N significantly suppresses PEDV replication, overexpression of TGEV N, like that of PEDV N, increases production of PEDV RNA and virions. Despite partial interchangeability in nucleocapsid oligomerization and viral RNA synthesis, endogenous PEDV N cannot be replaced in the production of infectious PEDV particles. Results from this study give insights into functional compatibilities and evolutionary relationship between CoV viral proteins during viral co-infection and co-evolution."
