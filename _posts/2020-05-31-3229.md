original:
- "Recently emerged human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, a novel lethal strain (Chan et al., 2020) of coronavirus, caused a global pandemic burden, affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals, having life-threatening outcomes, not only in medically compromised persons but also in perfectly healthy young individuals with immunocompetent system. Apparently, this specific coronavirus must possess special abilities to spread and compromise the immune mechanisms in humans. Unfortunately, there are limited evidence-based data available, as, which is understandable clinicians and scientists must focus on life-saving aspects (Prompetchara et al., 2020). At the same time, the question arises, whether this strain possesses unique abilities to penetrate via oropharyngeal epithelial barriers and, which is even more intriguing, why infection of SARS-CoV-2 triggers such abnormal 'cytokine storm' and immunosuppression? For unknown reasons, SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to be effectively defeated by human first line protective mechanisms, neither biomolecular, nor cellular, as number of death cases in middle aged, healthy persons were reported, regardless their immune status (Mehta et al., 2020)."
