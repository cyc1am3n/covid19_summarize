summary:
- "Coronovirus disease 2019 has??spread rapidly??across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. Literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment. The two children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms."

original:
- "Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has??spread rapidly??across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination??results of the children and their family members were described. The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them??had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both children??recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children."
