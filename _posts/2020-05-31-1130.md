original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented disruption to the normal way of life for people around the globe. Social distancing, self-isolation or shielding have been strongly advised, or mandated in most countries. We suggest evidence-based ways that people can maintain, or even strengthen their mental health during this crisis. Attempts to contain the pandemic spread of COVID-19 infection have caused fundamental changes to the way of life of individuals around the world. The UK Government has asked that wherever possible, people should stay at home and practice social distancing, and that the most vulnerable individuals should shield themselves completely. Other countries around the world have applied even more stringent measures than these, restricting many people to their homes by law."
