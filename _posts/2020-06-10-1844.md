summary:
- "Coronavirus COVID-19 caused growing cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China. As of 12 February 2020, a total of 45,204 confirmed cases had been reported from China and 519 confirmed cases from 27 countries worldwide. Among the reported victims, 1116 died. Countries over the world can make rely entirely on confirmed data but underestimate the actual size of infections. The lack of symptoms from the virus in its dormant state can delay confirmation."

original:
- "A mathematical simulation of coronavirus COVID-19 estimated the number of infections to be far worse than reported. Starting in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, caused growing cases of atypical pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China. The virus spread. As of 12 February 2020, a total of 45,204 confirmed cases had been reported from China and 519 confirmed cases from 27 countries worldwide. Among the reported victims, 1116 died. When facing an epidemic as such, a dangerous mistake that countries over the world can make is to rely entirely on confirmed data but underestimate the actual size of infections. Causes of underestimation include the limitation of resources, as there can be insufficient quarantine spaces, detection reagents, and medical personnel to identify infections in real time. Additionally, the lack of symptoms from the virus in its dormant state can delay confirmation. There is also a fear of data being manipulated or downplayed by officials due to economic and political concerns."
