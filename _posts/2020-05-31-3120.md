original:
- "This work shows a patent database for Coronaviruses that provides an overview of the patenting activity and trends in focused antiviral therapy with the use of triazole based compounds, glycoprotein, and protease inhibitors as possible treatment. The patent data was obtained from Orbit Intelligence Software using a patent family structure to get a big database that could be used for built patent landscape report (PLR), market analysis, technical and competitive intelligence, and monitoring and survey of a new ideas for the treatment of coronavirus diseases. The raw data is reported in four databases, which were classified according to different items: legal status (alive, dead), 1st application year (after 2015, 2011-2015, 2006-2010, 2001-2005), and Top 5 International Patents Classifications (IPC). The main players, the investment trend, markets, geographical distribution, technology overview, technologies distribution, and patent citation are showed by this analysed data report."
