summary:
- "growth factor receptors are known to be involved in the process of viral infection. repurposing drugs that have initially been developed may prove to be a fast track to effective therapies against emerging new viral infections. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may prove effective. It may also prove effective in preventing emerging new viruses. Growth factor receptor signaling in cancer may be fast track. Many viruses use receptors to physically attach to cell surface and internalize. They also divert receptor tyrosine kinase receptors."

original:
- "Growth factor receptors are known to be involved in the process of viral infection. Many viruses not only use growth factor receptors to physically attach to the cell surface and internalize, but also divert receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in order to replicate. Thus, repurposing drugs that have initially been developed to target growth factor receptors and their signaling in cancer may prove to be a fast track to effective therapies against emerging new viral infections, including the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)."
