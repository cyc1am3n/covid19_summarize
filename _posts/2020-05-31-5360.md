summary:
- "the critical type of COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful treatment of NIV. Active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support, accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and control."

original:
- "Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events are an important factor in the deterioration of some cases. The critical type of COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death. Early start with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against the possible physiological abnormalities could be helpful to improve prognosis. Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful treatment of NIV. In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support, accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and control."
