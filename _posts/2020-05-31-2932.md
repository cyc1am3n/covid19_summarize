- "Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia or arthralgia. 3 Recently, Giacomelli et al. reported that about one third (20/59, 33.9%) of the SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalized patients had an olfactory or taste disorder. 4 SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic stages, and therefore, olfactory and taste disorders can be significant signs for its early detection to control transmission. We found that olfactory and taste disorders can be the first and only signs of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia"
