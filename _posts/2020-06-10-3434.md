summary:
- "Zhou et??al and Hoffmann identify ACE2 as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The latter??show its entry mechanism depends on cellular serine protease TMPRSS2. These results may explain proinflammatory cytokine release via the associated angiotestin II pathway and a possible therapeutic target via the IL-6-STAT3 axis. They may explain a potential therapeutic target."
