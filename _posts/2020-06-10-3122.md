summary:
- "Italy has caused 6088 cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5 March 2020. We modeled the transmission process in Republic and Italy with a stochastic model and estimated the basic reproduction number R0 as 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.2 (95% C: 2.9-3.5) in Republic. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and Italy. It has caused 41 deaths and 6088 case and 41 cases and Italy caused 107 deaths and 41 in Republic, 344 cases and 31 deaths in the Republic of Italy by the 5 March."
