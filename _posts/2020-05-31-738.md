- "To the Editor: Starting from the first official case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recorded in Italy on February 21, 2020 in Codogno, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread in Northern Italy, bringing Lombardy to be the second world epicenter after China and the first European outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization and treatment in a sub-intensive and intensive regime has rapidly increased, leading to a sudden and unexpected oversaturation of hospitals and healthcare network. Currently, on April 27th, 199.414 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Italy, with 26.977 deaths. Starting from March 2020, in order to contain the transmission of the infection, the Italian Government approved a series of decrees (the latest issued on April 10), declaring the lockdown and quarantine status."
