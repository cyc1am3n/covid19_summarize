original:
- "Clinical features of infected pediatric patients The age of onset ranged from 1 month to 17 years in the 28 confirmed pediatric patients. All were family clusters or with a close contact history. The clinical features are variable in pediatric patients. Several patients displayed no obvious clinical symptoms at diagnosis, and they were found by screening because of close contacts with confirmed patients; and further chest imaging suggested pneumonia. Several gradually presented with fever, fatigue, dry cough, accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, runny nose, and seldom gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examination in pediatric patients showed that blood routine was often normal, and C-reactive protein was normal or transiently elevated. Lung imaging examination revealed mild increase of lung markings or ground-glass opacity or pneumoniaID - Shen2020"
