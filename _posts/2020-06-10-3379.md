summary:
- "Detection of 2019-nCoV is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers. Reports were expected to be published in mid-february. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection. 30 laboratories in 30 European Union/European coronavirus infection cases in specialised laboratory."
