- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-22 is still active in Wuhan, China, and is spreading to the rest of the world. Recently, perioperative anesthetic management in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus-2 have been reported. However, there is little report on the anesthetic management of patients undergoing aortic dissection repair with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. During the outbreak, our team has successfully completed four cases of aortic dissection repair in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The purpose of this report is to summarize current knowledge and experiences on anesthetic management in this patient population, and to provide clinical practice guidelines on anesthetic management, infection prevention and control in these critically ill patients."
