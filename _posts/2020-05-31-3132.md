summary:
- "the patient is a female infant with biliary atresia. She recovered well, with improving liver function tests for 4 days. On post-operative day the patient developed respiratory distress and fever. COVID-19 testing was positive. Liver biopsy showed moderate acute hepatitis with prominent clusters of apoptotic hepatocytes and associated cellular debris. Lobular lymphohistiocytic inflammation was noted."

original:
- "We present a case of COVID-19 hepatitis in a living donor liver allograft recipient whose donor subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The patient is a female infant with biliary atresia (failed Kasai procedure). She recovered well, with improving liver function tests for 4 days. On post-operative day (POD) 4 the patient developed respiratory distress and fever. COVID-19 testing (polymerase chain reaction) was positive. Liver function tests increased approximately 5-fold. Liver biopsy showed moderate acute hepatitis with prominent clusters of apoptotic hepatocytes and associated cellular debris. Lobular lymphohistiocytic inflammation was noted. Typical portal features of mild to moderate acute cellular rejection were also noted."
