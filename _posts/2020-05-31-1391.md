summary:
- "tracheotomy carries a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the health care team performing the procedure. We share our institution's surgical safety checklist for performing. Due to viral aerosolization, the procedure is a potential necessary step in the patient with coronavirus disease 19 and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The safety checklist includes key modifications intended to mitigate risk to the surgical team. Our institution share our surgical safety list for performing the operation in patients with the disease 19 (COVID19) We share the patient's safety checklist a possible necessary step to prevent transmission of a virus to the patient."
