summary:
- "Zhang and colleagues describing the predictive value of D-dimers tested on admission on in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. Several uncertainties must be mentioned, says Zhang. The paper is a useful laboratory marker for clinical teams managing the patients. We read with great interest the paper by Zhang & colleagues [1]. A number of uncertainties may need to be mentioned."

- "We read with great interest the paper by Zhang and colleagues [1], describing the predictive value of D-dimers tested on admission on in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. These interesting results may supply an easy-to practice laboratory marker to clinical teams managing the patients. However, a number of uncertainties must be mentioned."
