summary:
- "Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS. There is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component. We chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes. To provide a fast immunogenic profile, we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that the rapid development of the vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier."

original:
- "Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on toll-like receptor-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes, we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that the rapid development of the vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier."
