summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world, causing a huge reaction. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide. 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS CoV-2 at the time of writing. The problem is probably being overestimated, as 2.6m people die each year of respiratory infection compared to less than four000 deaths."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus from China, is spreading around the world, causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside China and the Far East. Four common coronaviruses are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide. This article compares the incidence and mortality rates of these four common coronaviruses with those of SARS-COV-2 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is concluded that the problem of SARS-CoV-2 is probably being overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing."
