summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now. Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy. It clustered with other infections reported from Wuhan since December 2019. The outbreak has been linked to China and 25 countries. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clusters with other SARS. CoV-2) infection has been reported from China since December. We isolated a large outbreak started in China since the outbreak started from China."

original:
- "Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is found to cause a large outbreak started from Wuhan since December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea. Cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero cell cultures were confluent 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample. Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan."
