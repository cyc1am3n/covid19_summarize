summary:
- "Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shows a rapid spread over-the-world. Two-thirds of European patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID19 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, indicating the significance of this history in early diagnostics."

original:
- "Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shows a rapid spread over-the-world. Given scarce resources, non-laboratory diagnostics is crucial. In this cross-sectional study, two-thirds of European patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, indicating the significance of this history in the early diagnostics."
