summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is causing COVID-2019. Over-expressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection. NF-kB is involved in increasing clinical severity of the outbreak. Previous studies have uncovered whole genome sequence of SARS. CoV-2. Prevtella may have role in COV-2019 outbreak and should be given importance for understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes. The outbreak has become a global threat by rapid transmission and severe fatalities. Infected patients in Wuhan, China has a genome sequence causing the outbreak at Wuhan has been linked to overrepresentation."

original:
- "Motivation The outbreak of COVID-2019 initiated at Wuhan, China has become a global threat by rapid transmission and severe fatalities. Recent studies have uncovered whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-2019). In addition, lung metagenomic studies on infected patients revealed overrepresented Prevotella spp. producing certain proteins in abundance. We performed host-pathogen protein-protein interaction analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and overrepresented Prevotella proteins with human proteome. We also performed functional overrepresentation analysis of interacting proteins to understand their role in COVID-2019 severity. Results It was found that over-expressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection. As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019. Prevotella may have role in COVID-2019 outbreak and should be given importance for understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
