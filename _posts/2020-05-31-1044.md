summary:
- "COVID-19 pandemic has upended nearly every medical discipline. In many areas of the country, elective orthopedic surgery has completely stopped to ensure resources are available for the critically ill and to minimize the spread of disease. Most national and international orthopedic conferences, training programs, and workshops have been postponed or canceled. We are now critically evaluating the delivery of education to our colleagues as well as residents and fellows."

original:
- "The COVID-19 global pandemic has upended nearly every medical discipline, dramatically impacted patient care and has had far-reaching effects on surgeon education. In many areas of the country, elective orthopedic surgery has completely stopped to ensure that resources are available for the critically ill and to minimize the spread of disease. COVID-19 is forcing many around the world to re-evaluate existing processes and organizations and adapt to carry out business, of which medicine and education are not immune. Most national and international orthopedic conferences, training programs, and workshops have been postponed or canceled, and we are now critically evaluating the delivery of education to our colleagues as well as residents and fellows. This article describes the evolution of orthopedic education and significant paradigm shifts necessary to continue to teach ourselves and the future leaders of our noble profession."
