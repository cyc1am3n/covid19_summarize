summary:
- "the potential for central nervous system involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a matter of grave concern. A neuroradiologist should be aware of the potential mechanisms involved in the neuropathogenesis of this virus. There is evidence in the basic sciences to support this possibility. The potential for CNS involvement in the disease is an issue of serious concern and there is evidence to support it. It is possible that the virus could be implicated in a neuropathic disease."

original:
- "The potential for central nervous system (CNS) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a matter of grave concern and there is a relevant body of evidence in the basic sciences to support this possibility. A neuroradiologist should be aware of the potential mechanisms involved in the neuropathogenesis of this virus, as we begin to see cases with abnormal brain scans emerging from all parts of the world."
