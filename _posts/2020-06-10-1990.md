summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. In this case report, we described a case with clinical course more than two months. A patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment. Virus RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days."

original:
- "As an emerging infectious disease, the clinical course and virological course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be further investigated. In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical course more than two months. This patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral specific antibodies were produced during recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva. In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARAS-CoV-2 from host's immune system. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
