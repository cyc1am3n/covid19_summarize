original:
- "We are now over three months into a viral pandemic (COVID 19) that has already left a trail of death and destruction, wreaking social and economic havoc, and disrupting, in most parts of the world, just about every aspect of life?and it is far from over. It is therefore a source of some pride that the scientific and medical professions have responded in exemplary fashion and continue to do so. Despite the interruptions to their research programs and careers, scientists have pooled resources and expertise, and health care providers have manned the trenches. The levels of cooperation and sharing throughout the global community are unprecedented as medicine and science have collectively taken on a common foe, often accompanied by the refocusing of individual work at the expense of established activities."
