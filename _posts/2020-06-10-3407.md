summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection spreads globally. Radiology departments should implement strict infection control measures and robust operational plans to minimize disease transmission. The authors share several operational guidelines and strategies implemented in our practice to reduce spread of COVID. They maintain clinical and educational needs of a teaching hospital. In this article, authors share some operational strategies and guidelines to reduce the spread of the disease. This article outlines several operational strategies to minimize the spread and mitigate potential impact of possible staff infection."

original:
- "As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection spreads globally, the demand for chest imaging will inevitably rise with an accompanying increase in risk of disease transmission to frontline radiology staff. Radiology departments should implement strict infection control measures and robust operational plans to minimize disease transmission and mitigate potential impact of possible staff infection. In this article, the authors share several operational guidelines and strategies implemented in our practice to reduce spread of COVID-19 and maintain clinical and educational needs of a teaching hospital."
