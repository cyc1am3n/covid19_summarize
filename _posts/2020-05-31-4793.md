original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which started in December 2019 in China, has resulted in a pandemic leading to significant morbidity and mortality across the globe. Although it mainly causes respiratory symptoms, respiratory failure and death due to multi organ failure, there is evolving evidence to suggest GI and liver involvement by this virus. Due to this, health care professionals taking care of GI and liver diseases are also at an increased risk of getting exposed. So, there is a need for protocols to be prepared to guide the handling of COVID 19 patients by the GI & liver specialists as well as to manage the preexisting GI & liver diseases during the ongoing pandemic. We present here the guidelines prepared jointly by the three Indian professional bodies in the field of GI diseases, namely the Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of India (SGEI), Indian Society of Gastroenterology (ISG) and Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver (INASL)."
