summary:
- "we present the perspective on the seasonal change on SARS-CoV-2 decay and COVID-19 spread. We present reasons why we can be optimistic about the slowdown of corona in the upcoming summer. Corona is expected to slow down in the summer if temperatures and humidity are increased. Our arguments are based on a structural similarity of coronalavirus with several enteric viruses, and its vulnerability. It is possible that increasing temperature and humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of SARS. The world may not wait for the summer so impatiently in the entire Anthropocene."

original:
- "To date, the world perhaps has never waited for the summer so impatiently in the entire Anthropocene, owing to the debate whether increasing temperature and humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV-2. We present the perspective on the seasonal change on SARS-CoV-2 decay and COVID-19 spread. Our arguments are based on: i) structural similarity of coronavirus with several enteric viruses, and its vulnerability; ii) reports related to decay of those similar transmissible gastroenteritis viruses (TGEV) like norovirus and iii) improvement in the human immunity during summer with respect to winter. We present reasons why we can be optimistic about the slowdown of corona in the upcoming summer."
