summary:
- "2 of the initial 7 (28.6%; 95% CI 8.2%-64.1%) pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection developed cardiac dysfunction with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) 33% of those in intensive care developed cardiomyopathy. More data are needed to ascertain the incidence of cardiomyopathie from CoVID19 in pregnancy, in all pregnant women."

original:
- "In our institution, 2 of the initial 7 (28.6%; 95% CI 8.2%-64.1%) pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection developed cardiac dysfunction with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) of 40%-45% and hypokinesis. Viral myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have been reported in non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. A case series of non-pregnant COVID-19 patients demonstrated that 33% of those in intensive care developed cardiomyopathy. More data are needed to ascertain the incidence of cardiomyopathy from COVID-19 in pregnancy, in all pregnant COVID-19 women, as well as those with severe (e.g. pneumonia) disease. We suggest an echocardiogram in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, in particular those necessitating oxygen, or critically ill, and we recommend handheld, point-of-care devices where possible to minimize contamination of staff and traditional, large echocardiogram machines."
