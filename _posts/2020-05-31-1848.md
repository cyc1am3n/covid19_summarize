summary:
- "the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally. The route of transmission of this virus is still controversial. We enrolled 33 patients without any ocular manifestation. SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the normal surface of COVID19 patients. This suggests this virus may be spread through conjunctival contact. RNA was detected strong positive in samples of both eyes."

original:
- "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, while the routes of transmission of this virus are still controversial. We enrolled 33 patients, without any ocular manifestation, with their ocular surface swabs collected for virus detection. RNA was detected strong positive in samples of both eyes from two patients. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the normal ocular surface of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that this virus might be spread through conjunctival contact."
