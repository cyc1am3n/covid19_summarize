There were 853 contacts, 242 of whom have been in close contact, 2 of whom have confirmed positive (case 25-26) and 240 had negative reactions. The third cluster was cases 27-32. The index patient was currently uncertain. There were 828 contacts, 183 of whom have been in close contact, 5 of whom have confirmed positive (case 28-32) and 179 had negative reactions. All contacts of three clusters have been isolated and no new confirmed cases have been identified to date CONCLUSION: Taiwan CECC made some measures which may not completely stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but they are being implemented to slow the spread of the disease and are currently not widespread in Taiwan.
