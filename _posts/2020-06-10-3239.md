summary:
- "Palliative care services are under-resourced at the best of times. The 2017 Lancet Commission described the lack of access to inexpensive and effective interventions as a travesty of justice. As health systems become strained under COVID-19, providing safe and effective palliativ care becomes especially vital and especially difficult. Those services are not the better of times; they are not a good thing to do."

original:
- "Palliative care services are under-resourced at the best of times. The 2017 Lancet Commission on Palliative Care and Pain Relief described the widespread lack of access to inexpensive and effective interventions as a travesty of justice. And these are not the best of times. As health systems become strained under COVID-19, providing safe and effective palliative care, including end-of-life care, becomes especially vital and especially difficult."
