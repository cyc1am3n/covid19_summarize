summary:
- "Dr Stein was struck by the analysis of the known mortality data from COVID-19. He says risk of mortality seems to be lower for respiratory pathogens than with pre-existing cardiac pathology. Dr Stein's response was thoughtful and considered. Stein says he is grateful for his thoughtful response to his recent letter((1)) He says his answers only raised more questions as he predicted. For a pathogen, risk is lower for those with underlying respiratory disease."

original:
- "I am most grateful to Dr Stein for his thoughtful and considered response to my recent letter((1)) . However, completely as he predicted, his answers only raised more questions. I was struck by the analysis of the known mortality data from COVID-19. It is interesting that for a respiratory pathogen, risk of mortality seems to be lower for those with underlying respiratory disease than with pre-existing cardiac pathology."
