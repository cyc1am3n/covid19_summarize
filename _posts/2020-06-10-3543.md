summary:
- "the current COVID-19 pandemic is stretching the global supply situation for face masks and PPE beyond production capacity. We need comparative R&D for extended, reuse and recyclability options and large scale approaches and methods that could quickly be applied on the local level by the public who are not experts and may only have limited resources. Virology and bio-medical experts are a call for the community to engage and collaborate with virology experts. The current COVD-19 Pandemic stretched the supply for PPE is extending the global production capacity is stretched beyond production. COVId-19. CoVID."

This is a call for the R&D community, particularly in the polymer degradation and stability arena, to engage and collaborate with virology and bio-medical experts. We require comparative R&D for extended, reuse and recyclability options, as well as large scale approaches and methods that could quickly be applied on the local level by the public who are not experts and may only have limited resources."
