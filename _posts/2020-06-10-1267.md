summary:
- "the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world. Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-coV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003. The outbreak has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive."

original:
- "The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans. Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease."
