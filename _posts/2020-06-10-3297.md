summary:
- "the evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic(1) is certainly cause for concern. Proper communication and optimal decision-making is an ongoing challenge. The challenge is compounded by exaggerated information. It is important to differentiate promptly the true epidemic from an epidemic of false claims and potentially harmful actions. This can lead to inappropriate actions, he says."
