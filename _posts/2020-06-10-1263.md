summary:
- "in December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to China and over 100 countries around the world. It is difficult to distinguish between COVID and some types of new-onset ILD or other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD."

original:
- "In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to China and over 100 countries around the world. The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 has many similarities with the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) . Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of new-onset ILD or other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD. Clinicians need to comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics, clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis. Because of this, the article will discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions."
