original:
- "Health crises have become a popular topic of discussion. In the wave of the ongoing pandemic, experts have suggested the role of vaping and other tobacco product use exemplifying the vulnerability of the population to contract the COVID-19. We discuss some of the events that led up to these conclusions and also offer a unique insight into another form of tobacco use that is potentially propagating its spread especially in the South Asian region-chewed tobacco. Both of these have been a perennial issue that head and neck cancer surgeons have been dealing with. Governments and head and neck cancer care providers now have an opportunity to deal with a common enemy in the midst of this pandemic."
