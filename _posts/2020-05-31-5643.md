summary:
- "Chest CT demonstrates a high sensitivity in patients with COVID-19. CT imaging findings are similar to features of other viral pneumonias. This outbreak raises important clinical questions relevant to radiological community. The speed of acquisition of CT and timely reporting by radiologists will help our ED colleagues make a diagnosis within minutes, not hours or days. A few reports have been published recently highlighting the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in diagnosis."
