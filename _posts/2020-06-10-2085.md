summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia epidemic. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of the virus. However, only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts. The virus is likely originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. It is unlikely to be transmitted to humans due to lack of direct contact."

original:
- "SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia epidemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2."
