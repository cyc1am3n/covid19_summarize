summary:
- "7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. Our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings. These findings might serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment. The findings might also serve as an alternative to clinical diagnosis. We report findings for seven patients with the disease in a 2-family cluster. They may also be useful for clinical diagnoses and medical treatments."
