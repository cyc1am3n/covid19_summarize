summary:
- "pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city, China. As of 8 February 2020, the assays have successfully detected 25 positive cases of infection in Japan. Two nested RT-PCR assay and two real-time RT assay were adapted to local Japanese conditions. Many airline travelers moved between Wuhan and Japan at that time, suggesting that Japan is at high risk of invasion by the virus. Diagnostic systems for the virus were developed with urgency. The as of the end of 2019 emerged in China in the early 20th century."
