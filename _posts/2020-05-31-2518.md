summary:
- "dental surgeons are at the forefront of practitioner-patient cross-transmission. Dentists are among the medical professionals who are particularly exposed to Covid-19. Dental practitioners are then exposed to saliva which plays a role in human-to-human transmission of diseases, he says. Zahn surgeons must stay abreast of this outbreak and appreciate precautionary practices that are potentially crucial to protect themselves, their relatives and their patients during this outbreak."

original:
- "Dentists are among the medical professionals, who are particularly exposed to Covid-19 (Meng et al. 2020, Yu et al. 2020). Indeed, in additional to the nasal passages the mouth is a privileged place of contamination; urgent or emergent dental care is often invasive and requires aerosolization (Ather et al 2020). Dental practitioners are then exposed to saliva which plays a role in the human-to-human transmission of diseases, in particular respiratory coronaviruses (Sabino-Silva et al. 2020, Lu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2011). We believe that dental surgeons are at the forefront of practitioner-patient cross-transmission. It is imperative that dental surgeons stay abreast of this outbreak and appreciate essential precautionary practices that are potentially crucial to protect themselves, their relatives and their patients during this outbreak."
