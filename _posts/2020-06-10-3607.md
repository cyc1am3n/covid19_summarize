summary:
- "Pollution represents a leading threat to global health and ecosystems. Systems-based initiatives require theoretical and translational platforms to address chemical pollution. Comparative and predictive toxicology are providing integrative approaches for identifying contaminants, designing less hazardous alternatives, and reducing the impacts of chemical pollution. Pollution is a threat to planetary health, EcoHealth, and One Health. Using toxicology, systems-based programs require a translational approach to address the problem."
