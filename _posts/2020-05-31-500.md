summary:
- "ACE2 cleaves a single residue from Ang I to generate Ang (1-7) This enzyme counterbalances ACE function decreasing Ang II levels. This enzyme has a protective role against excessively high blood pressure values and high level of renin-angiotensin system activation(2). The enzyme is protected by copyright. It is also protected by the right to use this article. ACE 2 is able to convert Ang 1-7 to produce Ang."

original:
- "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) removes a single residue from Ang I to yield Ang (1-9) and cleaves a single residue from Ang II to generate Ang (1-7). Thus ACE2 counterbalances ACE function decreasing Ang II levels(1) . Consequently, this enzyme has a protective role against excessively high blood pressure values and high level of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation(2) . This article is protected by copyright.
