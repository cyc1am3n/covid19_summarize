summary:
- "novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread. Risk of fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%) The most recent information is increasingly indicative of sustained human transmission. The overall severity profile among cases may change as more mild cases are identified. We estimate a risk of fatalities among hospitalized cases."
