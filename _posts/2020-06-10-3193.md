summary:
- "This review highlights the ultrasound findings from a number of studies and case reports. We discuss the potential role for portable point-of-care ultrasound (PPOCUS) as a safe and effective bedside option in the initial evaluation, management, and monitoring of disease progression in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. The avian (H7N9) and H1N1 influenza epidemics are among the unifying findings."
