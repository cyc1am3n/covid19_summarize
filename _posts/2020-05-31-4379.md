summary:
- "drug repurposing is a strategy consisting of finding new indications for already known marketed drugs used in various clinical settings or highly characterized compounds. Successful rate accounts for 30% of new FDA approved drugs and vaccines in recent years. Efforts have been made to provide structural features and mode of actions of drugs. The success rate is estimated to account for approximately 30 per cent of new drug treatments. This review focuses on the status of the drug treatment approach for various diseases."

- "Drug repurposing is a strategy consisting of finding new indications for already known marketed drugs used in various clinical settings or highly characterized compounds despite they can be failed drugs. Recently, it emerges as an alternative approach for the rapid identification and development of new pharmaceuticals for various rare and complex diseases for which lack the effective drug treatments. The success rate of drugs repurposing approach accounts for approximately 30% of new FDA approved drugs and vaccines in recent years. This review focuses on the status of drugs repurposing approach for various diseases including skin diseases, infective, inflammatory, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Efforts have been made to provide structural features and mode of actions of drugs."
