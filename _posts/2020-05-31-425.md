summary:
- "CoVs mainly cause enteric and / or respiratory signs. Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. In chickens the majority of the known coVs belong to the Alphacorona virus genus. However, recombination of an apha or betacoronanavirus with a gammacoravirus is extremely unlikely."

original:
- "Coronaviruses (CoVs) mainly cause enteric and / or respiratory signs. Mammalian CoVs including COVID-19 (now officially named SARS-CoV-2) belong to either the Alphacoronavirus or Betacoronavirus genera. In birds the majority of the known CoVs belong to the Gammacoronavirus genus, whilst a small number are classified as Deltacoronaviruses. Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, recombination of an apha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely. For recombination to happen, the 2 viruses would need to be present in the same cell of the same animal at the same time; a highly unlikely scenario as they cannot replicate in the same host!"
