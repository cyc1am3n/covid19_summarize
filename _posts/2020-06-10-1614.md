summary:
- "the patients were classified into two groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic/mild symptoms. Patients designated in the group had a fever for more than 3 days, obvious pneumonia patches on chest radiographs, and respiratory distress defined as oxygen saturation less than 95% or needing oxygen supply during hospitalization. Samples from the respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing included oropharyngeal swabs, oral gargling, and sputum. All samples were enrolled in this study. Fourteen COVID-19 patients. The patients were classed in two groups."

original:
- "Fourteen COVID-19 patients who were treated at six hospitals in Taiwan between January and March 2020 were enrolled in this study. The patients were classified into two groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic/mild symptoms. Patients designated in the symptomatic group had a fever for more than 3 days, obvious pneumonia patches on chest radiographs, and respiratory distress defined as oxygen saturation less than 95% or needing oxygen supply during hospitalization. Patients who did not meet the criteria of the symptomatic group were included in the asymptomatic/mild symptom group. Samples from the respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing included oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, oral gargling, and sputum. All samples were submitted to virology laboratories validated and contracted by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention in Taiwan for testing.2 Three sets of primers and probes targeting SARS-COV-2 envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes were used. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, all respiratory samples were simultaneously evaluated for the presence of Influenza A/B viruses using RT-PCR. When the results were negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A/B viruses, an additional SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test for another respiratory sample from the suspected COVID patient was performed."
