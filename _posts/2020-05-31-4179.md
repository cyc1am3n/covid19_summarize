summary:
- "the number of cases of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) rise in the United States (US) The number of severe cases (those requiring ICU admission) rise with it. Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on experience from China. Of patients admitted to the ICU, up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support. This has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine. The World Health Organization?s estimate from China for severe and critical cases in the U.S. CoV-2 rises in the US is near 20%."

Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on experience from China.1, 2 However, the World Health Organization?s (WHO) estimate from China for severe and critical cases is near 20% (Table).3 The primary clinical feature of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the severity of which directs the clinical course; it has been estimated that, of patients admitted to the ICU, up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support.4 This has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine."
