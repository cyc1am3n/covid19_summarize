summary:
- "We developed a digital triage tool to be sent to patients to quickly identify people with high risk of COVID-19 infection. This tool will limit unnecessary accesses to the MS centers reducing the risk of spreading it. We propose a possible approach for the remote monitoring of infection risk in people with multiple sclerosis. The tool will also limit access to MS centers to reduce the spread of the infection risk. It will also reduce unnecessary access to the centers. Using the tool, patients will be able to pinpoint people with a potential approach for identifying people with the tool to detect people with HIV. Tool. Digital triage."
