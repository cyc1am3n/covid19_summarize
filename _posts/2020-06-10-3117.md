summary:
- "Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) is fostering a vibrant debate, crossed by deep fears. The recommendation is to the patients to whom the CoViD-19 epidemic has compromised respiratory capacity. We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices. ICU doctors must decide whether to implement intensive treatments for patients who need them to survive."
