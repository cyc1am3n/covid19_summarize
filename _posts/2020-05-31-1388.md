In view of this, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of front line healthcare workers at two acute NHS hospital Trusts in England.

However, more still needs to be done, particularly in relation to educating HCW about the laboratory diagnostics. HCW is expected to be prepared for the Pandemic. The effectiveness of these interventions is unknown to prepare for the health service to prepare. National efforts to prepare HCW."

- "National efforts are underway to prepare our health service for the pandemic of COVID-19; however, the efficacy of these interventions is unknown. In view of this, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of front line healthcare workers (HCW) at two large acute NHS hospital Trusts in England, to assess their confidence and perceived level of preparedness for the virus. We demonstrate that there has been moderate success in readying HCW to manage COVID-19, but that more still needs to be done, particularly in relation to educating HCW about the laboratory diagnostics."
