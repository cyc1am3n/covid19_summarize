summary:
- "the prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by COVID infection. The ACE system is not uniformly expressed in all the human races. Current differences could hypothesize some geographical discrepancies of infection around the world. Animal studies showed that ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infections. In this report we summarized the current evidences in favour or against the administration of ACE blockade in the era. This report summarizes the evidences to support or against administration of current drugs ACE-i/ARB is high. Hypertension is linked to increased risk of infection in the human race."

original:
- "The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by COVID infection and it appears related to increased risk of mortality in many epidemiological studies. The ACE system is not uniformly expressed in all the human races, and current differences could hypothesize some geographical discrepancies of infection around the world. However, animal studies showed that ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection. Because two third of the hypertensive patients take ACE-i/ARB, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current drugs. In this report we summarized the current evidences in favour or against the administration of ACE blockade in the COVID era."
