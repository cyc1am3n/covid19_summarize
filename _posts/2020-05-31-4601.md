We read with interest the article of Guillen et al. 1. Here, the authors described the management of a kidney transplant patient.

original:
- "We read with interest the article of Guillen et al. 1. Here, the authors described the management of a kidney transplanted patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 that causes novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors stated that immunosuppressed patients might present with atypical clinical manifestation (fever, diarrhea, fatigue) without respiratory symptoms. Also Li and colleagues 2 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in two solid organ transplanted patients. The two heart transplanted patients presented with variable severity of COVID-19 (one mild and another with more severe manifestations requiring a prolonged hospitalization), however, both survived the event."
