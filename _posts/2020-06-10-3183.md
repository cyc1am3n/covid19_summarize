summary:
- "N95 respirator supply chains are severely strained and conservation strategies are needed. The process extends the life of the respirators using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) disinfection. It allows healthcare workers to retain their own respirator across a large metropolitan health care system. A multidisciplinary team at the Washington University School of Medicine, Barnes Jewish Hospital, and BJC Healthcare was formed to implement a program to disinfect N95 respiratoryators. In the U.S., the supply chain is strained by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. PPE has been an invaluable yet limited."
