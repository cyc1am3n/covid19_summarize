summary:
- "SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources. It may be a useful tool for SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively. Experts in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education are essential."

original:
- " Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic. Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations. Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid up-skilling of non-specialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care. It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively."
