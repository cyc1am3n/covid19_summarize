summary:
- "we first studied the dynamics profile of SARS-CoV-2 from 56 recovered COVID-19 patients. We found virus shedding was up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. Prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients - a novel coronavirus pandemic threatens the world. A novel panddemic is threatening the world. Here, we first looked at the dynamics profiles of the COV-2 virus. The virus was shedding up to six weeks after the symptoms onset. It's analyzed the dynamics of 56 recovered CSR-coV-2. SARS.."
