summary:
- "apprehension gets exemplified in a palliative care clinic, as patients have limited life expectancy. The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. Practical steps suggested include protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs, greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans and embracing the role of a wider community support."

original:
- "Health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive critical care and who cannot. In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy. The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context. Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support."
