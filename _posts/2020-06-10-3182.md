summary:
- "COVID-19 has been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquines have been used to treat disease. This calls into question the role of these medications as preventive therapy. Health care workers are at risk at a time when they are badly needed during a health care crisis. The role of the medications as prevention therapy is also at risk."

original:
- "People exposed to COVID-19 have a risk of developing disease, and health care workers are at risk at a time when they are badly needed during a health care crisis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis. Our patient developed COVID-19 while on hydroxychloroquine and although more work is needed, this calls into question the role of these medications as preventive therapy."
