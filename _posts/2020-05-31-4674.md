summary:
- "RNA betacoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO. Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection."

original:
- "A novel RNA betacoronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO. Guo W et al published the first report of biochemical features in patients with diabetes and the further risk that this disease can determine to the progression of Covid-19. Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation, may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection. Targeting the over expression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.
