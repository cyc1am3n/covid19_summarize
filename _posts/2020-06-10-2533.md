summary:
- "COVID-19 is a prime example of this emerging type of problem. This research note introduces the concept of Complex Intergovernmental Problems (CIPs) The concept of CIPs generates more analytical power to understand the management of this pandemic in federations and multi-level governance systems. It will significantly affect intergovernmental relations in Canada over both the short and long terms. The nature of this problem requires intergovernmental coordination and cooperation for effective policy responses. Developing countries face complex policy challenges."

original:
- "Federations increasingly face complex policy challenges, from managing climate change to mass migration. COVID-19 is a prime example of this emerging type of problem. This research note introduces the concept of Complex Intergovernmental Problems (CIPs) to better understand these types of challenges. While political leaders and media often describe COVID-19 as a crisis, the concept of CIPs generates more analytical power to understand the management of this pandemic in federations and multi-level governance systems. The nature of this problem requires intergovernmental coordination and cooperation for effective policy responses. At the same time, COVID-19 will significantly affect intergovernmental relations in Canada over both the short and long terms. Highlighting how COVID-19 intersects with intergovernmental relations allows us to better assess how governments have responded and will facilitate comparative research."
