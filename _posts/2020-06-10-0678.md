summary:
- "Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN) can scale to test many samples. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection enables robust testing of >4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health."

original:
- "The overwhelming majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples(1-3) while simultaneously testing for many pathogens(4-6). Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanoliter droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents(7) self-organize in a microwell array(8) to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of >4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with >/=10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. CARMEN's intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test >300-fold. Scalable, highly-multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health(9-11)."
