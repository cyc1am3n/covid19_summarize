- "UNSTRUCTURED: Disasters and pandemics pose unique challenges to health care delivery. As healthcare systems are set to be further stretched with the increasing burden of COVID-19, telemedicine, including tele-education may be effective way to rationally allocate medical resources. During the COVID-19 pandemic, practice showed that telemedicine was a feasible, effective way with good acceptability in western China, translating in significant improvement in professional coverage in this underserviced area. The successes of telemedicine in western China may provide a useful reference for other parts of the world."
