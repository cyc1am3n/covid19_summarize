summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has posed a serious threat to global public health. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by the disease. Previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronanavirus. The pathogen is the pathogen of 2019 novel coronivirus disease (COVID-19) The WHO has declared the outbreak an international public health emergency."

original:
- "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health. The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection an international public health emergency. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19."
