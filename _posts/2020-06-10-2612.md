summary:
- "Novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out from Wuhan, spreading to the whole nation and world since Dec, 2019. Previous epidemiological investigations and animal experiments suggest aerosol could perform as virus transmitter. This study focuses on the feature of aerosol transmission, and the pathogens involved in. Relevant strategies are established, serving as references to the medical personnel and general public during their work or daily life. It is now the critical stage to fight against the virus."

original:
- "Novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out from Wuhan, and spreading to the whole nation and world since Dec, 2019. It is now the critical stage to fight against the virus. Previous epidemiological investigations and animal experiments suggest aerosol could perform as virus transmitter. Based on the clinical observation, the possibility of aerosol transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus has aroused a lot of attention. This study focuses on the feature of aerosol transmission, and the pathogens involved in. We analyzed the possibility of aerosol transmission for the novel coronavirus. Relevant strategies to prevent novel coronavirus pneumonia are established, serving as references to the medical personnel and general public during their work or daily life.
