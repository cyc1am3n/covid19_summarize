summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for COVID-19. To provide meaningful guidance to patients, existing mortality data must be considered and appropriately applied. Most people infected with the virus will recover, but mortality increases with age and co-morbidity in those who develop severe illness. Current mortality data needs to be considered, appropriately applied to patients. The virus is not generalizable and lack of morbidity and functional outcomes in survivors."

original:
- "Accurate prognostication is challenging in the setting of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, due to rapidly changing data, studies that are not generalizable and lack of morbidity and functional outcomes in survivors. To provide meaningful guidance to patients, existing mortality data must be considered and appropriately applied. While most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will recover, mortality increases with age and co-morbidity in those who develop severe illness."
