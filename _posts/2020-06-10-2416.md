title: "Fear of COVID-19: Insights from evolutionary behavioral science"

summary:
- "Fear of infectious disease is substantially different from that evoked by other medical conditions. Selective pressures have favored the evolution of a behavioral immune system that is separate from, and complementary to, the physiological immune system. The psychological mechanisms (i.e. disgust and fear) involved in the immune system impact also on aspects that pertain to social psychology. Acknowledging the existence of psychological and behavioral adaptations to avoid infection has important implications for public health programs."

original:
- "Fear of infectious disease is substantially different from that evoked by other medical conditions. Such a difference depends on psychological and behavioral adaptations shaped by natural selection throughout the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. Selective pressures have favored the evolution of a behavioral immune system that is separate from, and complementary to, the physiological immune system. The two systems interact in a complex way. The psychological mechanisms (i.e. disgust and fear) involved in the behavioral immune system impact also on aspects that pertain to social psychology (i.e. xenophobia, conformism, and authoritarianism). Acknowledging the existence of psychological and behavioral adaptations to avoid infection has important implications for public health programs, including the necessity of fighting stigma and the dubious utility of trauma debriefing for healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 emergency."
