- "Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern. This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally. We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms). This is to our knowledge the longest duration of viral shedding reported to date. This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged."
