summary:
- "Coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 disease is a global public health concern. We recommend postponement of elective gynecological endoscopic surgeries until the pandemic is contained. Emergency surgeries should preferably be done through open surgeries than laparoscopy or hysteroscopy approach. When COVID-19 is highly suspected, the patient should be referred to centers equipped in taking care of such cases."

original:
- "Coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is a global public health concern. Although there is a paucity of evidence to advise on the best practice, we recommend postponement of elective gynecological endoscopic surgeries until the pandemic is contained. Emergency surgeries should preferably be done through open surgeries than laparoscopy or hysteroscopy approach. However, if or when laparoscopy or hysteroscopy is considered, health personnel in theatre must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and all standard precautions should be observed to prevent COVID-19 infection. When COVID-19 is highly suspected or confirmed, the patient should be referred to centers equipped in taking care of such cases."
