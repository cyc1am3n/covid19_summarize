summary:
- "Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province. The main clinical symptoms of the disease are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for the disease, but its accuracy is limited. Nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID19, but has a low sensitivity is low."

original:
- "Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country. Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count. While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited. The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low. There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination. This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment."
