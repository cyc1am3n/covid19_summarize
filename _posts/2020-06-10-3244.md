summary:
- "as at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe via air travel. Three reported cases in France, one in Germany. Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk.

We consider travel restrictions in place, three reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe."
