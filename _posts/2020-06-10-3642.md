summary:
- "the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is highly infectious and lack of proven therapeutic drugs and licensed vaccines effective against it. The common chest CT imaging shows ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, and consolidation. Early diagnosis of the disease is of paramount importance. Despite the high infectious nature of the virus, early diagnosis is crucial. There are no proven specific therapeutic drugs effective against the disease. CoVID19 cases are discussed here."
