summary:
- "Currently, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. The Coronavirus Disease 19 infection has been prevalent in China and spread to other countries. There are a few published cases of the infection occurring during pregnancy and due to the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission. A total of 31 pregnant mothers with the disease were reported. Two mothers died from the infection after delivery."

original:
- "Since early December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) infection has been prevalent in China and eventually spread to other countries. There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions: Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Mothers may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications."
