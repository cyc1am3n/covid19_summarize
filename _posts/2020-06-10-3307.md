summary:
- "Lung ultrasound has become a tool for assessment of patients stricken by the novel coronavirus 2019. Use of LU has helped us in clinical decision making and reduced the use of both chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT) Over the past two and a half months we have used this modality for identification of lung involvement along with pulmonary severity in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 infection. The modality has been widely used in clinical decisions."

Over the past two and a half months (January, February and first half of March 2020) we have used this modality for identification of lung involvement along with pulmonary severity in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 infection. Use of LU has helped us in clinical decision making and reduced the use of both chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT)."
