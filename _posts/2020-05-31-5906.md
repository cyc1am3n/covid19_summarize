- "Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are grim at present. In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency operation reasonably, etc. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and severity of the disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening. While fighting the epidemic, medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of patients. However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new management system should be developed. Based on the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by physicians."
