summary:
- "patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen. As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan. Virus was identified as a pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coroniavirus."

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed."
