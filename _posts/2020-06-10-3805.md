summary:
- "the ongoing SARS-CoV2 outbreak has developed into a global pandemic. No vaccine or other medication for an effective treatment are currently available. Endo-lysosomal two-pore cation channels have emerged as potential novel targets for SARS treatment. The ongoing outbreaks of SARS CoV and the related MERS CoV in recent years. Despite previous outbreaks, neither a vaccine or any other medication is currently available for effective treatments. A vaccine and any other drug for effective treatment in the ongoing outbreak has now emerged as a pandemie."
