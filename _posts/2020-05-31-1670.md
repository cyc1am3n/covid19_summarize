summary:
- "Brodin discussed why COVID-19 appears to be so mild in children (1). The author discussed the potential theories that could explain why children have a lower incidence and milder clinical manifestations than adults. We feel it is important to present some other additional hypotheses in order to address all the possible theories. Brodin's editorial discussed the possibility of milder symptoms in children. He also discussed the possible explanations for children having a milder incidence than adults, he says."

original:
- "We read with great interest the editorial by Brodin discussing why COVID-19 appears to be so mild in children (1). In particular, the author discussed the potential theories that could explain why children have a lower incidence and milder clinical manifestations than adults. However, we feel it is important to present some other additional hypotheses in order to address all the potential theories."
