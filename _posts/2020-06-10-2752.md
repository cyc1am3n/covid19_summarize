summary:
- "the technique of nasopharyngeal wash has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections. The current emphasis is on preventive strategies such as social distancing, face mask, and hand washing. randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role and mechanism of the technique in COVID-19. There are studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. This suggests hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash to prevent the virus has led to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)."

original:
- "Rapid transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current emphasis is on preventive strategies such as social distancing, face mask, and hand washing. The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections. In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19. The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19."
