summary:
- "children with congenital heart disease are at-risk for both COVID-19 and secondary cardiovascular outcomes. FitbitTM step-counts measured the impact of the pandemic on physical activity in children with CHD. Steps were markedly lower in late March and early April 2020, compared to 2019 and early March 2020. It is vital to understand how precautions will impact the health of CHD children, especially if they persist long-term."

original:
- "Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at-risk for both COVID-19 and secondary cardiovascular outcomes. Their increased cardiovascular risk may be mitigated through physical activity, but public health measures implemented for COVID-19 can make physical activity challenging. We objectively measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, continuously measured by FitbitTM step-counts, in children with CHD. Step-counts were markedly lower in late March and early April 2020, compared to 2019 and to early March 2020. It is vital to understand how precautions for COVID-19 will impact the health of children with CHD, especially if they persist long-term."
