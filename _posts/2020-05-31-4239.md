summary:
- "in this paper, we provide an overview of city-level information that define urban intelligence for supporting response to disease outbreaks. We present five components that have been previously investigated but remain siloed to successfully orchestrate an integrated pandemic response. This paper highlights limited expertise in urban data applications during a Pandemic outbreak. Previous epidemic management research proves the importance of city information, but also highlights limited knowledge in urban datasets during an outbreak. We emphasize the urgency of building urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice at the global scale, a comprehensive overview of urban intelligence that defines urban intelligence in combination with analytical and operational capacity."

- "UNSTRUCTURED: Previous epidemic management research proves the importance of city-level information, but also highlights limited expertise in urban data applications during a pandemic outbreak. In this paper, we provide an overview of city-level information, in combination with analytical and operational capacity, that define urban intelligence for supporting response to disease outbreaks. We present five components (movement, facilities, people, information, engagement) that have been previously investigated but remain siloed to successfully orchestrate an integrated pandemic response. Reflecting on the COVID-19 outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, China, we discuss the opportunities, technical challenges, and foreseeable controversies for deploying urban intelligence during a pandemic. Finally, we emphasize the urgency of building urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice at the global scale."
