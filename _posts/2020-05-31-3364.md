summary:
- "Passengers were screened with oropharyngeal swabs on arrival for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many of the passengers tested positive (3.6% from UK, 6.3% from Spain and 66% from Turkey) Despite almost all passengers being asymptomatic, many tested positive. Some tested positive, indicating widespread transmission of SARS. Several passengers were on repatriation flights to Greece from the UK, Spain and Turkey."
