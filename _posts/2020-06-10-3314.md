original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread fast and extensively around the world, with significant mortality and morbidity. As this is a respiratory infection, chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) are important imaging techniques in the work-up of this disease. Given its highly infectious nature, cross-infection within the healthcare setting and radiology departments needs to be addressed actively and prevented. We describe the response of radiology departments in Singapore to this pandemic, in terms of diagnosis, re-configuration of the department, re-organisation and segregation of staff, infection control, managerial, and leadership issues."
