summary:
- "Throat washing is a promising candidate for 2019-nCoV screening and monitoring due to its noninvasive and reliability. Positive testing rate of throat washing was much higher than that of Nasopharyngeal swabs. The 2019 novel coronavirus was detected in the self-collected throat washings. It is expected to be screened and monitored by the next year's ncoV screening program."
