title: "Can a century-old TB vaccine steel the immune system against the new coronavirus?"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb8297"
author:
- Vrieze, Jop de

summary:
- "researchers in four countries will start a clinical trial of an unorthodox approach to the new coronavirus. They will test whether a century-old vaccine against tuberculosis can rev up the human immune system in a broad way. The studies will be done in physicians and nurses, who are at higher risk of becoming infected with the respiratory disease than the general population, and in the elderly. Researchers will test if TB can better fight the bacterial disease and prevent infection with it altogether. Study will be preparing for a trial of a centuries-old anti-tuberculo virus."

original:
- "Researchers in four countries will soon start a clinical trial of an unorthodox approach to the new coronavirus. They will test whether a century-old vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial disease, can rev up the human immune system in a broad way, allowing it to better fight the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 and, perhaps, prevent infection with it altogether. The studies will be done in physicians and nurses, who are at higher risk of becoming infected with the respiratory disease than the general population, and in the elderly, who are at higher risk of serious illness if they become infected."
