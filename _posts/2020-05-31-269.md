summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe respiratory failure due to massive alveolar damage. Currently, no adequate curative therapy for COVID-19 disease exists. There are no appropriate curative therapies for the disease. Antonioloforte: ECMO support is evident. He says the need for extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support is growing. The emergence of veno-venous support is a major concern."

- "SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe respiratory failure due to massive alveolar damage. Currently, no adequate curative therapy for COVID-19 disease exists. By considering overall impact of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, an increased need of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support becomes evident. We report on our preliminary institutional experience with COVID-19 patients receiving veno-venous ECMO support. Disclosures: None.
