summary:
- "ACPGBI and BDRF led the way on patient and public involvement (PPI) in colorectal research. The 2013-16 Delphi Games led to the integration of patients as key partners in research studies, as well as studies such as CIPHER and PREPARE ABC. Colorect research studies have been suspended due to the need for routine work to be reduced to focus resources on critical care. Several studies in the pipeline will resume."

- "ACPGBI and BDRF led the way on patient and public involvement (PPI) in colorectal research with the 2013-16 Delphi Games, which led to the integration of patients as key partners in research studies, as well as studies such as CIPHER and PREPARE ABC. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the majority of colorectal research studies suspended, given the need for routine work to be reduced to focus resources on critical care. When we look to return to a new normal, these studies and others in the pipeline will resume."
