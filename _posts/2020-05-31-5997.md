link: "https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12578"
author:

summary:
- "the next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will affect health and health care. Nurses will be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected as ordinary citizens. Future resilience of healthcare services will depend on having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the coming challenges. The next decade will produce pan-national infections such as COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming."
