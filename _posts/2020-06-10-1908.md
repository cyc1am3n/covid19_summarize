summary:
- "Several loopholes have been identified in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments. Loopholes are due to poor understanding of the emerging disease. We recommend setting up an isolation zone for patients not completely cleared of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Retrospective analysis of 2 cases of health-care-associated COVId-19 transmission in 2 departments and comparing the practices of our department. Closholes were in large part due to limited understanding of highly contagious coronavirus cases of COV-coved infections in the infections. in the practices.."

- "OBJECTIVES: To improve the infection control and prevention practices against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in radiology department through loophole identification and providing rectifying measurements. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 2 cases of health-care-associated COVID-19 transmission in 2 radiology departments and comparing the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 with the practices of our department, where no COVID-19 transmission has occurred. RESULTS: Several loopholes have been identified in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments. Loopholes were in large part due to our limited understanding of the highly contagious coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is characterized by features not observed in other SARS viruses. We recommend to set up an isolation zone for handling patients who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 but are not completely cleared of the possibility of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Loopholes in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments are due to poor understanding of the emerging disease which can be fixed by establishing an isolation zone for patients not completely cleared of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
