summary:
- "A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019. The rapidly increasing number of cases has caused worldwide panic. In this review, we describe some currently applied diagnostic approaches to prevent, treat and control further outbreaks. This review describes some current applied therapeutics and vaccines to prevent and treat the virus. We describe some current used diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics, to prevent a further outbreak of SARS.
