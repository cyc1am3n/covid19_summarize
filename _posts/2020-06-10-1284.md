original:
- "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread to over 113 countries with 118,326 infected and 4,292 died as of 11 March 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) has just announced COVID-19 a global pandemic. A person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 is less likely to present initially to the ophthalmologists compared to emergency care or internal medicine physicians. However, in late February 2020, 2 patients presented simultaneously to our eye casualty with sudden onset of unilateral painful red eye associated with a decline in visual acuity, their intraocular pressure (IOP) were over 40 mmHg and slit-lamp examination findings were suggestive of acute primary angle closure (APAC)."
