summary:
- "many countries are already indicating a dramatic increase in reported cases of domestic violence. The impact of natural disasters on family violence reports may provide important insight for victim-serving professionals. Improving collaboration between human welfare and animal welfare agencies, expanding community partnerships, and informing the public of the great importance of reporting any concerns of abuse are all critical at this time. Many countries already indicate a significant increase in reports of domestic abuse. There is no clear precedent for the current crisis in academic literature."

original:
- "Though necessary to slow the spread of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), actions such as social-distancing, sheltering in-place, restricted travel, and closures of key community foundations are likely to dramatically increase the risk for family violence around the globe. In fact many countries are already indicating a dramatic increase in reported cases of domestic violence. While no clear precedent for the current crisis exists in academic literature, exploring the impact of natural disasters on family violence reports may provide important insight for family violence victim-serving professionals. Improving collaborations between human welfare and animal welfare agencies, expanding community partnerships, and informing the public of the great importance of reporting any concerns of abuse are all critical at this time."
