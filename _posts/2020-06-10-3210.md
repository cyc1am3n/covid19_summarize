summary:
- "a recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The CT scan showed multiple regions of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in COVID19 patients. We report three cases of the disease with dynamic pulmonary CT evaluation. There have been some reports of imaging findings regarding the disease's characteristic features. Here we report 3 cases of Corona virus disease 2019."

- "A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There have been some reports of imaging findings regarding the disease's characteristic features. Here, we report three cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dynamic pulmonary CT evaluation. The CT scan showed multiple regions of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in COVID-19 patients and the CT scan was useful in tracking the progression or regression of COVID-19."
