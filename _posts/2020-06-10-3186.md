summary:
- "COVID-19 has spread from a marketplace in Wuhan, China to over 150 countries and territories of the world. Therapeutics are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease. hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This finding was quickly supported by an open label non-randomized clinical trial that provided the first published clinical evidence HCQ may be a treatment option."

Therapeutics are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease. It has been reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and this finding was quickly supported by an open label non-randomized clinical trial that provided the first published clinical evidence HCQ may be a treatment option."
