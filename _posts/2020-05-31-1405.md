- "The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global health care systems in ways that simply could not have been imagined just several months ago. Writing from the heart of New York City - the unfortunate new epicenter of this pandemic - we have been confronted with this new reality head-on. As directors of two major academic cardiac catheterization laboratories in the city, we both have had to operationalize logistical planning of physician and staff redeployments as well as modification of our respective hospital units including conversion of large portions of the catheterization laboratory into COVID-19 intensive care units in order to deal with the surge of COVID-19 patients within the hospital."
