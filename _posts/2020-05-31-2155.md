summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the activity of interventional oncology in hospitals and cancer centers. A literature review of potential solutions in a context of scarce anesthesiologic resources, limited staff and limited access to hospital beds is proposed and discussed based on the literature data. We discuss the changes that need to be done for the organization, safety, and patient management. In this review, a literature review is proposed."

- "The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the activity of interventional oncology in hospitals and cancer centers. In this review based on official recommendations of different international societies, but also on local solutions found in different expert large-volume centers, we discuss the changes that need to be done for the organization, safety, and patient management in interventional oncology. A literature review of potential solutions in a context of scarce anesthesiologic resources, limited staff and limited access to hospital beds are proposed and discussed based on the literature data."
