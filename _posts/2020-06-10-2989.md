original:
- "Since December 2019, the pandemic coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV; COVID-19) has changed the approach to all dermatological diseases; in particular, psoriatic patients undergoing immunosuppressive drugs, such as biologics, can potentially show an increase risk of infection (1). However, few reports are available on the course of COVID-19 infection in psoriatic patients treated with biological drugs (2). We describe a case series of four psoriatic patients treated with biologics who had a risk contact with COVID-19."
