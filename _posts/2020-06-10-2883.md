- "The 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has cost a great loss to the health and economic property of Chines people. Under such a special circumstance, how to deal with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious challenge. Rapid diagnosis of concomitant COVID-19, safe and effective transportation, implementation of the interventional procedure, protection of vascular surgical team and postoperative management and follow-up of such patients have become urgent problems for us. Combined with the latest novel government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered the above questions briefly and plainly. We also hope to inspire the national vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even routine vascular diseases with COVID-19, as a final point to limit the severe epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of COVID-19."
