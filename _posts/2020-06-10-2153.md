summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus. The state of Washington (WA) had the first reported case and death related to COVID 19 in the United States. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are at a unique risk of exposure to SC2. Symptoms will lead to lasting changes in policy development for viral testing guidelines, personal protective equipment (PPE) stewardship, surgical scheduling, and residency education and training. COV-2 virus in late December 2019 has placed an overwhelming strain on healthcare institutions nationwide."

original:
- "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus, in late December 2019 has placed an overwhelming strain on healthcare institutions nationwide. The modern healthcare system has never dealt with a pandemic of this magnitude, the ramifications of which will undoubtedly lead to lasting changes in policy and protocol development for viral testing guidelines, personal protective equipment (PPE), surgical scheduling, and residency education and training. The State of Washington (WA) had the first reported case and death related to COVID 19 in the United States (US). Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are at a unique risk of exposure to SC2 and developing COVID-19 due to our proximity of working in and around the oro- and nasopharynx. This article summarizes the evolution of COVID-19 guidelines in four key areas: 1. preoperative SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) testing, 2. personal protective equipment (PPE) stewardship, 3. surgical scheduling guidelines, and 4. resident education and training for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA."
