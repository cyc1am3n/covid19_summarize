summary:
- "the spread of COVID-19 isn't the first, and won't be the last, time institutions of higher learning have to respond to the danger of rapidly spreading infection. Keeping students, faculty, and staff protected from this invisible threat is typically the job of an interdisciplinary team that includes campus public safety, health services, and, often, local agency partners. The job is typically a team that focuses on public safety and health services."
