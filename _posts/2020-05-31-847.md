summary:
- "the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can result in myocardial injury, heart failure, arrhythmias. Investigational therapies for the infection can interact with the cardiovascular system. Our division organized an approach to manage these complications. The model presented can provide a framework for other institutions to organize their own approaches. Adapted to local constraints, resource availability, and emerging knowledge."

original:
- "The infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19, can result in myocardial injury, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In addition to the viral infection itself, investigational therapies for the infection can interact with the cardiovascular system. As cardiologists and cardiovascular service lines will be heavily involved in the care of patients with COVID-19, our division organized an approach to manage these complications, attempting to balance resource utilization and risk to personnel with optimal cardiovascular care. The model presented can provide a framework for other institutions to organize their own approaches and can be adapted to local constraints, resource availability, and emerging knowledge."
