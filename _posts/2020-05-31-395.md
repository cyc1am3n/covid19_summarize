summary:
- "the coronavirus pandemic will doubtless show a remarkable, once in a generation. If we had human annular rings 2020 is destined to be as skinny as they come. For dentistry these are hard times indeed. 'There, another oak.' Trees come to mind just now because of their fascinating pattern. Variations in width of each ring for each year of growth shows how in some years it is strong and robust, others thin and weak."

original:
- "Family anecdote has it that my paternal great grandfather when out walking in the countryside in the autumn would stop whenever he saw a fallen acorn and make a hole in the ground with his walking stick. Tapping the nut into the earthly cavity and covering it with soil he would proudly declare 'there, another oak.' Trees come to mind just now because of their fascinating pattern of annular rings, the concentric circles that show on the cut surfaces of trunks. The variations in width of each ring for each year of growth shows how in some years it is strong and robust, others thin and weak. The coronavirus pandemic will doubtless show a remarkable, once in a generation, once in a century slowdown of human activity and certainly of economic growth. If we had human annular rings 2020 is destined to be as skinny as they come. And for dentistry these are hard times indeed. "
