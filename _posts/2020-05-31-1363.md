summary:
- "the purpose of this article is to review new pediatric lung disorders. It is essential for radiologists to have a clear understanding of the characteristic imaging appearances of these lung disorders in pediatric patients to ensure optimal patient care. Some characteristic imaging findings have emerged or are currently emerging. Radiologists must have clear understanding. The clinical symptoms of SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and COVID-19 pneumonia may be nonspecific. OBJECTIVE. This article will review new lung disorders that have occurred in recent years include severe acute respiratory syndrome, a review of the purpose."

- "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review new pediatric lung disorders-including disorders that have occurred in recent years years such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine-origin influenza A (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia-to enhance understanding of the characteristic imaging findings. CONCLUSION. Although the clinical symptoms of SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and COVID-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients may be nonspecific, some characteristic imaging findings have emerged or are currently emerging. It is essential for radiologists to have a clear understanding of the characteristic imaging appearances of these lung disorders in pediatric patients to ensure optimal patient care."
