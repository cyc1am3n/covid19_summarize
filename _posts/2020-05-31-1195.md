summary:
- "the CoV-19 infection appears to be unusual among patients with type 1Diabetes Mellitus. This is partly due to the peculiar immune condition that leads to the destruction of the Beta cells. We think that this in part because of the peculiar immunity condition. The disease is thought to be a fragile population. Symptoms of the infection may be due to a weakened beta cell."
