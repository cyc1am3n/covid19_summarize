summary:
- "COVID-19 referred to the disease as a 'mysterious viral pneumonia' in January. Locals will travel a few hours from neighbouring villages for treatment. This time, as Myanmar shares borders with China and Thailand. But locals didn't fancy the risk of travelling to a big city. It was the first time I took the disease seriously. I was travelling through Myanmar with four colleagues. In January I read my first BBC news article. The disease was a viral pneumonia."

original:
- "It was in early January that I read my first BBC news article on COVID-19. It referred to this disease as a 'mysterious viral pneumonia' and back then very few of us appreciated its severity. We joked about how it shared the same name as a beer; never did we anticipate the degree of change the world would see. February came along and I was travelling through Myanmar with four colleagues. We had planned to set up a voluntary medical and dental clinic in a town near Mandalay. The medical team were kept busy throughout; however, as the week progressed our dental clinic started seeing fewer and fewer patients. This is unusual for health camps: locals will routinely travel a few hours from neighbouring villages for treatment. But this time, as Myanmar shares borders with China and Thailand (both reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases), locals didn't fancy the risk of travelling to a big city. This was the first time I took COVID-19 seriously. "
