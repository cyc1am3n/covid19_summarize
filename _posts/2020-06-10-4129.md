summary:
- "in this paper, we prove the almost sure convergences for the maximum and minimum of nonstationary and stationary standardized normal vector sequences under some suitable conditions. This paper demonstrates the convergences of the standardized sequences.. we show the perfect convergences in some appropriate conditions for the normal sequences in a suitable condition. We show the exact convergences between the vector sequence sequences and the sequences of normal vectors in the shortest time. The convergences can be found in the same conditions as the. this paper. the convergens are summarized in this. in some suitable. these convergences are."
