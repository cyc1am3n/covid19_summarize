summary:
- "the human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the infection of the disease outside of Wuhan. CT examination is important in the early detection and follow-up of disease. We should also think of the possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside Wuhan, he says. The disease may also be transmitted outside of the city. It is important to consider the possibility. the disease may be transmitted by a human to human transmission. TC examination is crucial in early detection."

original:
- "Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of Wuhan were reviewed. The human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the infection of the disease outside of Wuhan. CT examination is important in the early detection and follow-up of the disease. With a history of exposure or travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan."
