original:
- "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed intense pressure on healthcare organizations around the world. Amongst others, there has been an increasing recognition of common and deleterious cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 based on preliminary studies. Furthermore, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease are likely to experience a more severe disease course with COVID-19. As case numbers continue to increase exponentially, a surge in the number of patients with new or comorbid cardiovascular disease will translate into more frequent, and in some cases, prolonged rehabilitation needs following acute hospitalization. This manuscript describes the current status of post-discharge cardiac care in Canada and provides suggestions with regards to steps that policymakers and healthcare organizations can take to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic."
