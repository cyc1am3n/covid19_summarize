summary:
- "the COVID-19 epidemic is believed to have started in late January 2020 in France. We report a case of a patient hospitalized in December 2019 for hemoptysis with no etiological diagnosis. RT-PCR was performed retrospectively on the stored respiratory sample. Based on this result, it appears that the outbreak started much earlier. It appears the outbreak began much earlier in January 2020. The outbreak is thought to have begun much earlier than before."

We report here a case of a patient hospitalized in December 2019 in our intensive care, of our hospital in the north of Paris, for hemoptysis with no etiological diagnosis and for which RT-PCR was performed retrospectively on the stored respiratory sample which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Based on this result, it appears that the COVID-19 epidemic started much earlier."
