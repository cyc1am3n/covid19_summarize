summary:
- "COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been devastating to health care delivery in many parts of the US. Outpatient clinics transitioned to telemedicine, and hospitals being overrun with patients, liver transplant programs have been faced with the challenge of balancing patient and staff safety while operating in a resource limited environment. Despite shelter-in-place orders, hospitals are facing the threat of hospital overruns with COV-2 patients."
