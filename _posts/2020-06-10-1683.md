summary:
- "203 countries and territories have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak (Worldometer, 2020a) Older adults are negatively impacted by this pandemic. Current estimates suggest that age poses a major risk. Hence, there is no doubt age poses major risk for COVId-19 mortality. The prevalence of younger people infected by the virus is higher than that of older adults. Age alone is likely an insufficient criterion for predicting the direct medical impact of the outbreak."

original:
- "At the time of this writing, 203 countries and territories have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak (Worldometer, 2020a). Older adults, in particular, are negatively impacted by this pandemic (Lipsitch et al., 2020). Current estimates suggest that the COVID- 19 mortality rate stands at 15% for those over the age of 80, but 0 for those under the age of 10 (Worldometer, 2020b). Hence, there is no doubt that age poses a major risk for COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, there are incidental reports of centenarians, who recovered from COVID-19 and of younger adults, who have not (Coffey and Oransky, 2020; Lanese and Writer, 2020). Moreover, the prevalence of younger people infected by the virus is higher than that of older adults (Surveillances, 2020). Hence, age alone is likely an insufficient criterion for predicting the direct medical impact of the outbreak. In this commentary, I argue that the portrayal of all older adults as a homogenous, vulnerable group, rather than the use of a more refined discourse, which stresses the heterogeneity inherited in old age and the potential impact of the pandemic on society"
