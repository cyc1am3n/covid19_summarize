summary:
- "We have described the screening and management process for patients present to the out-patient clinics in China. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we have little reliable literature to refer to with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Our study has been admirably efficient in China in the past. It has been protected by the copyright of this article."
