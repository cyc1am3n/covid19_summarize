summary:
- "signs and symptoms of severe COVID-19 infection resemble more the pathophysiology and phenotype of complement-mediated thrombotic micoangiopathies (TMA), rather than sepsis-induced coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Since effective treatment is available for complement mediated TMA, we aim to describe relevant features. We aim to systematically describe relevant characteristics in patients with severe COVID-19 infections."

original:
- "Recent evidence suggests that signs and symptoms of severe COVID-19 infection resemble more the pathophysiology and phenotype of complement-mediated thrombotic micoangiopathies (TMA), rather than sepsis-induced coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Campbell and Kahwash 2020, Zhang, et al 2020). Since effective treatment is available for complement-mediated TMA (Gavriilaki 2020), we aim to systematically describe relevant features (clinical phenotype, pathophysiology and management) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection."
