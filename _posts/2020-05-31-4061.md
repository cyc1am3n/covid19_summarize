summary:
- "COVID-19 has become a public health emergency due to its rapid transmission. The appearance of pneumonia is one of the major clues for diagnosis, progress and therapeutic evaluation. More and more literatures about imaging manifestations and related research have been reported. This review focus on interpreting the CT findings, proposing the challenge of patients with underlying diseases, differentiating with other diseases and suggesting the future research and clinical directions."

More and more literatures about imaging manifestations and related research have been reported. In order to know about the progress and prospective on imaging of COVID-19, this review focus on interpreting the CT findings, stating the potential pathological basis, proposing the challenge of patients with underlying diseases, differentiating with other diseases and suggesting the future research and clinical directions, which would be helpful for the radiologists in the clinical practice and research."
