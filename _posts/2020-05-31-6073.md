summary:
- "since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) The virus can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronanavirus and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread. We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. It can cause severe pneumonia and a small outbreak of the new virus."
