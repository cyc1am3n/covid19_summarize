summary:
- "French doctors debated benefits of testing a coronavirus vaccine in Africa. This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical trials. Trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries are justified in low-and-middle-income countries because existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment) Underlying this ethical double standards in some trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected."

original:
- "A TV debate in April 2020 between two French doctors regarding the benefits of testing a coronavirus vaccine in Africa where there are no masks or treatments available has led to international criticism. This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment). Underlying this ethical double standard in some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected."
