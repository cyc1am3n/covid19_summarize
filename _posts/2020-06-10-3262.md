summary:
- "Chest radiography and chest CT are frequently used to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Multiple cases of transmission in radiology department have been reported. Here we summarize the lessons we learned and provide suggestions to improve the infection control and prevention practices of healthcare workers in departments of radiology. The virus is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has spread rapidly to become a world-wide pandemic."
