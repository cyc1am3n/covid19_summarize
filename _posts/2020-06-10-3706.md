summary:
- "since December 2019, a novel coronavirus has spread across China and across the world. Some studies reported cases of thrombocytopenia, but hardly any studies mentioned how the virus causes the disease. We propose several mechanisms by which the virus is causing a continuous increase in confirmed cases within a short period of time. Since December 2019, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world, causing an increase in cases. The virus causes a constant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the virus. There have been a number of cases have been reported in China and worldwide since December 2019."

Some studies reported cases of thrombocytopenia, but hardly any studies mentioned how the virus causes thrombocytopenia. We propose several mechanisms by which coronavirus disease 2019 causes thrombocytopenia to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options."
