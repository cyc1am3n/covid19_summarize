summary:
- "the pandemic of Coronavirus disease-19 spirals out of control. A few empirical studies have reported higher prevalence of mental health problems among women compared to men. Are there psychological repercussions of this outbreak on maternal health? Are perinatal maternal mental health disorders an inevitable burden of this pandemie? Could this be averted with a proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated health services approach targeting the vulnerable population of pregnant women? If this be avoided, the world is desperately frazzled at the moment."

original:
- "With the pandemic of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) spiraling out of control, the world is desperately frazzled at the moment. A few empirical studies related to this pandemic have reported higher prevalence of mental health problems among women compared to men.(1) In this context, pregnant women and new mothers could certainly be more vulnerable. Are there psychological repercussions of this outbreak on maternal health? Are perinatal maternal mental health disorders an inevitable burden of this pandemic? Could this be averted with a proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated health services approach targeting the vulnerable population of pregnant women?."
