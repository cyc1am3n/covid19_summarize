summary:
- "the COVID-19 has now been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. The use of off-label medications may be beneficial in the treatment. Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitors. Zanamivir, Indinavir and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3CLPRO main proteinase."

original:
- "The COVID-19 has now been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Method Utilization of the available sequence information, homology modeling, and in slico docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the COVID-19 two main drug targets the spike glycoprotein and the 3CL protease. Results Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitor for the COVID-19. Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir show potential as and 3CLPRO main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3CLPRO main proteinase. It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 Deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The use of these off-label medications may be beneficial in the treatment of the COVID-19."
