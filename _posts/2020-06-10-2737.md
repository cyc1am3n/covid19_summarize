original:
- "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic remitting-relapsing autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems. In this article we discuss aspects in the management of lupus patients that are particularly relevant during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We speculate that lupus patients might be more susceptible for a more severe COVID-19 disease course and emphasize the importance of maintaining remission in lupus patients. We discuss the critical role hydroxychloroquine plays in the management of lupus patients and suggest considering the psychosocial implications of the current pandemic on lupus care."
