summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has forced otolaryngologists and their patients to confront issues that they have rarely if ever faced. The need to put the collective good ahead of the interests of individual patients. We argue that the individual doctor-patient relationship remains paramount even at a time when public health principles mandate systems-level thinking. Whether the patient relationship is a priority, we argue."

Prominent among these is the need to put the collective good ahead of the interests of individual patients with otolaryngologic disorders. We argue that the individual doctor-patient relationship remains paramount even at a time when public health principles mandate systems-level thinking."
