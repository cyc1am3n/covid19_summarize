summary:
- "66-year-old Taiwanese woman contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while traveling abroad. She contracted the infection while she was in Taiwan. Her symptoms persisted despite medication prescribed on February 21 by a local medical doctor. No fever was noted during her disease course, she developed chest tightness, abdominal upset and vomiting. Incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.1 days, but it might be as long as more than three weeks in some extreme cases."

original:
- "This 66-year-old Taiwanese woman was well before. She traveled to Dubai from January 29 to February 10, 2020, and Egypt from February 11 to February 21, 2020. When she stayed in Egypt, she ever participated an eight-day tourism on a Nile cruise boat. She returned to Taiwan via an international airline on February 21, 2020. She began to suffer from general malaise, myalgia, cold sweating, productive cough, and sore throat since February 18, 2020. She reported that there were another 16 persons in the same tourism group had similar symptoms at that time. Her symptoms persisted despite medication, prescribed on February 21 by a local medical doctor. On February. 26, the cough exacerbated, and she developed chest tightness, abdominal upset and vomiting. She visited the Department of Emergency of a teaching hospital in Taipei on February 28. No fever was noted during her disease course. In the context of her travel history and prominent respiratory symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for test of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the result was positive. She was then transferred to a negative-pressure isolation room as a case of COVID-19. The most interesting point of this patient is where she contracted her COVID-19. By history, she is more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection while travelling abroad. However, despite that the median incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.1 days, it might be as long as more than three weeks in some extreme cases.6,7 Therefore, an argument that she got the infection while she was in Taiwan couldn't be excluded completely"
