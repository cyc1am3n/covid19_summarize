original:
- "Quarantine or physical isolation, used for centuries to contain the spread of infection, isolates those who have (or may have) been infected by a contagious disease to control or limit contamination. The COVID-19, a novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has rapidly spread across the globe becoming a pandemic. Modern quarantine strategies have been imposed globally in an attempt to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 infection including short- to medium-term lockdowns, voluntary home curfew, restriction on the assembly of groups of people, cancellation of planned social and public events, closure of mass transit systems, and other travel restrictions."
