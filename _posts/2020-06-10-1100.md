summary:
- "COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response towards social distancing is uncertain. Results suggest information sources formal (p=0.001) and informal) were found to be significantly influenced by situational awareness p=0.000. This article is protected by copyright.

original:
- "COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response towards social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources formal (p=0.001) and informal (p=0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness p=0.000. It can, therefore, be concluded that increase situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.
