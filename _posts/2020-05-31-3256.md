summary:
- "ACE2 upregulation confers protective effects in acute lung injury. renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors reduce adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes. Pre-clinical models suggest that ACE 2 upregulation gives protective effects. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic affecting millions of adults. Patients with or at risk for COVID are undergoing treatment."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic affecting millions of adults. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, infects host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Pre-clinical models suggest that ACE2 upregulation confers protective effects in acute lung injury. Additionally, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors reduce adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes, but may increase ACE2 levels. We review current knowledge of the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular physiology and SARS-CoV-2 virology as well as clinical data to inform the management of patients with or at risk for COVID-19 who require renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy."
