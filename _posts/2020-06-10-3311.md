summary:
- "a 40-year-old man developed acute brainstem dysfunction 3 days after hospital admission. Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in keeping with inflammation. No other cause explained the patient's abnormal neurological findings. He was managed conservatively with rapid spontaneous improvement in some of his neurological signs. The patient was discharged home with continued neurology follow up. MRI showed changes to the upper cervical cord and the brain. There was a novel SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) infection."

Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in keeping with inflammation of the brainstem and the upper cervical cord, leading to a diagnosis of rhombencephalitis. No other cause explained the patient's abnormal neurological findings.
