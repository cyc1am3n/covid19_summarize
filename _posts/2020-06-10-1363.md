original:
- "Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020, there have been 24 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. The majority of these cases (58.3%; n=14) were male, with a median age of 42 years (range, 21-62 years). Of the confirmed cases, 15 were index cases (63%), six were first-generation patients (24%), and three were second-generation patients (12.5%). All the first- and second-generation patients were family members or close acquaintances of index cases. All the index cases entered the South Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.6 days (median, 4 days) and the reproduction number (R0) was calculated as 0.5. Two of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic. As of February 8, 22 patients with 2019-nCoV are hospitalized in South Korea, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. The epidemiological indicators will be revised as new information becomes available in the future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers around the world is essential for efficient preparations and responses to new infectious diseases."
