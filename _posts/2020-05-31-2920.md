summary:
- "the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 123 countries. More than 5000 patients died from the virus. The original and intermediate hosts of the virus remain unknown. No antibodies were detected in above samples which excluded the possibility of 35 animal species as intermediate host. Pet dogs, cats, street dogs and cats also showed serological negative to the virus, which relieved the public concerns for the pets as carriers. This relieved public concerns about the pets. 5000 people died from it."

original:
- "The pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 123 countries with more than 5000 patients died from it. However, the original and intermediate hosts of the virus remain unknown. In this study, 1914 serum samples from 35 animal species were used for detection SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies using double antigen sandwich ELISA after validating its specificity and sensitivity. The results showed that no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected in above samples which excluded the possibility of 35 animal species as intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, companion animals including pet dogs (including one dog the SARS-CoV-2 patient kept and two dogs which had close contact with it) and cats, street dogs and cats also showed serological negative to SARS-CoV-2, which relieved the public concerns for the pets as SARS-CoV-2 carriers."
