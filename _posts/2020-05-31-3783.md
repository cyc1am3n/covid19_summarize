summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated cancelation of elective or non-urgent contact with the healthcare system. Clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner, while keeping them, health care personnel and the community safe. Benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process. Each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time."

original:
- "The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated cancelation of elective or non-urgent contact with the healthcare system, including non-urgent nerve conduction studies and electromyography (electrodiagnostic [EDX] studies). The definitions of elective and non-urgent are physician judgments, and often are not straightforward. Clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner, while keeping them, health care personnel and the community safe. Benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process. We have stratified EDX studies into 3 categories: Urgent, Non-urgent and Possibly Urgent, in an effort to help clinicians triage these referrals. For each category, we provide a rationale and some examples. However, each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in managing EDX triaging. Engaging the referring clinician and, at times, the patient, may be useful in the triage process. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
