summary:
- "the first coronaviruses discovered were the cause of pediatric and adult respiratory infections that were not particularly dangerous. One study from Vanderbilt found the virus in about 5% of samples from upper respiratory illness and 8% from lower respiratory illness. Adults also might also suffer severe infections [3, 4]. This was the picture as late as 2018. A group of respiratory viruses that could cause serious illness in the very young, but with negligible mortality [5, 6]."

original:
- "Coronaviruses are respiratory viruses whose appearance on electron microscopy looks like tiny crowns (Figure 1). The first coronaviruses discovered were the cause of pediatric and adult respiratory infections that were not particularly dangerous. One study from Vanderbilt found coronavirus in about 5% of samples from upper respiratory illness and 8% from lower respiratory illness [1]. Most clinically significant coronavirus infections have been found in children &lt; 2 years of age, as reviewed in this journal in 2009 [2], although adults also might suffer severe infections [3, 4]. This was the picture as late as 2018: a group of respiratory viruses that could cause serious illness in the very young, but with negligible mortality [5, 6]."
