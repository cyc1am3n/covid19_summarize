summary:
- "71.4% of non-survivors and 0.6% survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay. Results The overall mortality was 11.5% compared to survivors on admission (P0.05) NCP was reported in Wuhan, China. NCP cases were reported to have significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time."

original:
- "Background In the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, significantly abnormal coagulation parameters in severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) cases were a concern. Objectives To describe the coagulation feature of patients with NCP. Methods Conventional coagulation results and outcomes of consecutive 183 patients with confirmed NCP in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. Results The overall mortality was 11.5%, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time compared to survivors on admission (P<0.05). 71.4% of non-survivors and 0.6% survivors met the criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation during their hospital stay. Conclusions The present study shows that abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP are common in deaths with NCP."
