summary:
- "online survey reveals bottlenecks, challenges and barriers faced by more than 1,700 biology labs. More than 4,000 researchers in the U.S. suggest better coordination at an institution and national level could make hundreds of thousands more tests for coronavirus available. A survey of more than 14,000 researchers suggests better coordination. 4,000 research labs have been surveyed. The online survey also reveals challenges and challenges faced by over 1,700 labs in the United States. Survey reveals gaps and barriers to more tests. Online survey of 4,000 reveals shortages and challenges. Over 1,700 biologists."
