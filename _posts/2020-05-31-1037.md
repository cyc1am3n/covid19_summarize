summary:
- "China was hit hard by the &ldquo;Corona Virus Disease 2019. This study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. Results reveal that older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations&rsquo; attitude toward game meat is more negative, whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values."

original:
- "In December 2019, a novel laboratory-confirmed coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which has caused clusters of severe illnesses, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China. This foodborne illness, which reportedly most likely originated in a seafood market where wild animals are sold illegally, has transmitted among humans through close contact, across the world. The aim of this study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. More specifically, by using the data collected from 1008 respondents in January 2020, the time when China was hit hard by the &ldquo;Corona Virus Disease 2019&rdquo; (COVID-19), this study investigates the overall and different generational respondents&rsquo; health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat. The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents&rsquo; general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations&rsquo; attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents&rsquo; perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations&rsquo; future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations&rsquo; food beliefs are more stable."
