summary:
- "patients with Covid-19 disease develop cardiovascular complications on presentation or during the course of the disease. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency. She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement. The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement. We need more research in Covid19 patients for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment. Patients with Cardiovascular involvement often present with symptoms related to respiratory illness develop complications resulting from cardiovascular complications. STEMI. They present with respiratory illness."

original:
- "Patients with Covid-19 disease commonly present with symptoms related to respiratory illness, and less commonly they develop cardiovascular complications either on presentation or during the course of the disease. The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient outcomes. Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19. She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment."
