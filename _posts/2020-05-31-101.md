summary:
- "the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and associated myocardial injury is unknown. Patients with COVID-19 and acute cardiac injury have a mortality rate of over 50% in initial reports. Possible treatment options are unknown for the mechanism. I or T patients with a high-sensitivity troponin T. The mechanism is unknown, and possible treatment options for myocardal injury associated with SARS CoV-2 are not available. There are no indications of a treatment option for the disease."

original:
- "Patients with COVID-19 and acute cardiac injury as measured by an elevated high-sensitivity troponin I or troponin T upon admission or during hospitalization have a mortality rate of over 50% in initial reports. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and associated myocardial injury, whether SARS-CoV-2 patients with myocardial injury are a distinct population, and possible treatment options for myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 are unknown."
