summary:
- "the majority of patients developed robust antibody responses between 17 and 23 days after illness onset. Deayed, but stronger antibody responses were observed in critical patients. We profiled the serological responses to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) glycoprotein. The majority of the patients developed strong antibody responses. Stronger antibodies were observed. Patients developed robust antibodies between 17 to 23 days. Defayed and onset of severe symptoms. They developed strong antibodies. Most developed strong."
