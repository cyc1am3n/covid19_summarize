original:
- "The worldwide spread of COVID-19 highlights the need for an efficient approach to 31 rapidly develop therapeutics and prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2. The 32 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 33 subunit involved in receptor engagement, is a potential therapeutic target. We describe 34 the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting 35 na??ve complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into framework regions of a 36 human germline immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) allele. Panning 37 this library against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit identified fully human 38 single-domain antibodies targeting five distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with 39 subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of these antibodies neutralize 40 SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a cryptic epitope located in the spike trimeric interface. 41 Collectively, this work presents a versatile platform for rapid antibody isolation and 42 identifies promising therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as the diverse 43 immogneic profile of the spike protein."
