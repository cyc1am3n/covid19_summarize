summary:
- "RNA extracts of positive samples tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. Results A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples. Detection of negative samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. This pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories."

original:
- "The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented scale. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately-applicable protocol. Methods RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8- ,16-, 32- and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8. Results A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. Conclusions As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts."
