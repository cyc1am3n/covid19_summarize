summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease. Children are uniquely affected but the reasons are unclear. It is crucial that children are included in research as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronanavirus infection. This review will highlight the relationship of coronona virus disease 2019 with hypertension and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors."

original:
- "Potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Coronavirus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear. This review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective. We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway. Given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019."
