summary:
- "the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can vary from an asymptomatic course to an ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A kidney transplanted patient infected with SARS CoV2 infection showed a mild disease despite immune suppression. Immunosuppression can be protective as the cytokine storm is an important factor in the disease story. Solid organ transplant patients use precautions in order to avoid the infection."

original:
- "The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can vary from an asymptomatic course to ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A kidney transplanted patient infected with SARS CoV2 infection showed a mild disease despite immune suppression. It is possible that Immunosuppression can ?be protective? as the cytokine storm is an important factor in the disease story. Despite the good outcome reported in the present case report, is remains of vital importance the solid organ transplant patients use precautions in order to avoid the infection."
