summary:
- "researchers have detected a rise and fall in new coronavirus concentrations. The technique can pick up a sharp rise in viral concentrations in sewage before cases explode in the clinic. It points to its potential as a cheap, noninvasive tool to warn against outbreaks, they say. Researchers say the new study is the first to show that the technique picks up sharp rises in viral levels. That points to potential as an inexpensive, non-invasive tool. They say the technique could pick up an increase before outbreak in greater Paris for more than a month in new study."

original:
- "By sampling sewage across greater Paris for more than 1 month, researchers have detected a rise and fall in novel coronavirus concentrations that correspond to the shape of the COVID-19 outbreak in the region, where a lockdown is now suppressing spread of the disease. Although several research groups have reported detecting coronavirus in wastewater, the researchers say the new study is the first to show that the technique can pick up a sharp rise in viral concentrations in sewage before cases explode in the clinic. That points to its potential as a cheap, noninvasive tool to warn against outbreaks, they say."
