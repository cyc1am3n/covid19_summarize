summary:
- "a small minority of infected individuals develop severe disease in an age dependent manner. This supports a role for IFITM3 in disease pathogenesis and the opportunity for early targeted intervention in at risk individuals. The current global COVID-19 outbreak is a major unanswered question. We report that homozygosity for the C allele of rs12252 in the transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene is associated with more severe disease."
