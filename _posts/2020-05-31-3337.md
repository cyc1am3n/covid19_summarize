summary:
- "Ultrasonography is an essential modality widely deployed for patients, both in the ICU and on the wards. Narasimhan et al. [2] suggested changing from a compartmentalised approach to ultrasound to a standard whole body sonography. The new sonography included thoracic, cardiac and limited abdominal scanning, as well as evaluation for deep vein thrombosis."

original:
- "We read with great interest the recent article by Smith et al., which summarised the important role that lung ultrasound can play in patients with COVID-19 [1]. They also explore the mechanisms by which an expanded lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed and advocated for frameworks to support consolidation of lung ultrasound skills and competency during, and after, the pandemic. Ultrasonography is an essential modality that is widely deployed for patients, both in the ICU and on the wards, to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with cardiopulmonary failure. Narasimhan et al. [2] suggested changing from a compartmentalised approach to ultrasound, which focused on a single body system, to a standard whole body sonography which included thoracic, cardiac and limited abdominal scanning, as well as evaluation for deep vein thrombosis."
