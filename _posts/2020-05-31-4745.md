summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from three patients involved in first outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy. Early molecular epidemiological tracing suggests that SARS was present in Italy weeks before the first reported cases of infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Report describes the isolation, phylogenetic analysis of the first three genomes. The first three complete genomes were isolated from 3 patients involved."
