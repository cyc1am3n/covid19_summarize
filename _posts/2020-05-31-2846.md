summary:
- "vascular ultrasound laboratory and other imaging studies in COVID-19 positive patients have occurred. Most with markedly elevated D-dimer, and a presumed prothrombotic state in many of the very ill patients. This article summarizes a broad institutional consensus focusing on evaluation and recommended empirical therapy. We recommend following the algorithms with the idea that as more data becomes available that this may well change. As more data become available, this might well change, we recommend."
