summary:
- "for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus, the Italian government recently (February 2020) issued, among the methods of sanitizing the environments, the use of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide1. Hydrogen peroxyde is already widely used as an environmental, surgical disinfectant and as an oral disinfectant in the treatment of gingivitis, as reported in literature2,3."

original:
- "For the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus, the Italian government recently (February 2020) issued, among the methods of sanitizing the environments, the use of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide1 . Hydrogen peroxide is already widely used as an environmental, surgical disinfectant and as an oral disinfectant in the treatment of gingivitis, as reported in literature2,3 . SARSCoV-2 is spread by human-to-human transmission and the infection is estimated to have an average incubation period of 6.4 days and a base reproduction number of 2.24-3.584 . Furthermore, it has already been proved by scientific studies that the virus persists for two days on the mucous membranes in macaques5 before the subsequent spread of the virus to the lower respiratory tract. Thus, provides a window of therapeutic opportunity. The efficiently inactivation of Coronaviruses (e.g. SARS, MERS) on inanimate surfaces by the use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (0.5% in 1 minute) has been already assessed by Kampf et al6 . Based on these assumptions, and after an accurate reviewing of the current the literature concerning hydrogen peroxide, we assumed that hydrogen peroxide, as antiseptic agent, could play a pivotal role in the reducing of the hospitalization rate and in the complications of the patients. An antiseptic efficacy versus SARSCoV-2 can be reasonably hypothesized on oral and nasal mucosa thought the use of hydrogen peroxide 3% (10 volumes)."
