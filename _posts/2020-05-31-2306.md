summary:
- "COVID-19 had mild clinical course in patients with Agammaglobulinemia lacking B lymphocytes. It developed aggressively in Common Variable Immune Deficiency. Our data offer mechanisms for possible therapeutic targets. Using our data, we can find therapeutic targets for patients. CoVID was able to develop a mild course in the clinical course. We are looking at the potential therapeutic targets of the disease. The results are available in the U.S. and Canada."
