summary:
- "invasive ventilation in prone position can improve the prognosis, albeit with an increased risk of facial pressure ulcers. In case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, the ventilation can improve. The invasive venting in the prone positions improves the pronostic. This report will describe the high-complexity management of COVID 19 in which healthcare professionals across the world are still involved. We will relate a case in a SARS-CoV-2 positive 50 year-old woman with increased risk can improve prognoses, despite a prone posture. in case."
