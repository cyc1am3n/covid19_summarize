summary:
- "Stagnant water in unused buildings can harbour infectious bacteria and heavy metals. Scientists point out that guidance on reopening is limited. Some regions prepare to lift lockdowns in response to COVID-19. Researchers worry about the potential for a secondary health crisis waiting in the dormant plumbing of offices, gyms, restaurants and schools. Water is contaminated with infectious bacteria, metals and metals, scientists say."
