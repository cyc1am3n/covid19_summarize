summary:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 is widely spread and poses a critical threat to global health. Prominent changes in coagulation function in severe patients of COVID-19 have been reported in a recent study. We conducted this quantitative meta-analysis to explore the difference between severe and mild cases. The study was carried out by Han, et al 2020. It is hoped that the disease could be a major threat to health in the world. Coronavirus is a disease that is spread across the globe. CoVID-related disease 2019 (COVID19). Mendoza. a crucial threat."

Prominent changes in coagulation function in severe patients of COVID-19 have been reported in a recent study (Han, et al 2020). Therefore, we conducted this quantitative meta-analysis to explore the difference in blood coagulation parameters between severe and mild cases of COVID-19."
