summary:
- "We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs."

- "We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on the disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients are more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing the viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.
