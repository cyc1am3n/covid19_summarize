summary:
- "PDCoV is an emerging swine enteric coronavirus that causes diarrhea in piglets. The biological characteristics of the virus are unclear. HA assays showed a significant positive correlation with the infectious viral titer. Our results suggest that assessing the HA activity of PDcoV may be a useful diagnostic method for investigating and surveilling infections."

original:
- "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteric coronavirus that causes diarrhea in piglets. However, the biological characteristics of PDCoV are unclear. In this study, the hemagglutination (HA) abilities of two PDCoV strains (CH-01 and HNZK-04) were investigated. Our results showed that PDCoV has the ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes after virion pretreatment with trypsin or neuraminidase. Additionally, the HA assay results showed a significant positive correlation with the infectious viral titer. Our results suggest that assessing the HA activity of PDCoV may be a useful diagnostic method for investigating and surveilling PDCoV infections."
