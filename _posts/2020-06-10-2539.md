summary:
- "isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19. We urge international and national health authorities to consider the association. The association is not considered an essential part of the screening process. In this commentary, we briefly summarize the available data from Iran and other countries on the sudden increase. Increasing the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic. This is due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus, rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and hypogeusia was isolated as the sole initial presenting a symptom."

original:
- "In this commentary, we briefly summarize the available data from Iran and other countries on the sudden increase in anosmia, hyposmia, and hypogeusia that has coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. Alarmingly, a high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom, which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction. Since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19, we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with COVID-19, urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission. We urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic."
