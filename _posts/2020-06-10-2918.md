original:
- "The UK National Diabetes Inpatient COVID Response Group was formed at the end of March 2020 to support the provision of diabetes inpatient care during the COVID pandemic. It was formed in response to two emerging needs. First to ensure that basic diabetes services are secured and maintained at a time when there was a call for re-deployment to support the need for general medical expertise across secondary care services. The second was to provide simple safe diabetes guidelines for use by specialists and non-specialists treating inpatients with or suspected of COVID-19 infection. To date the group, comprising UK-based specialists in diabetes, pharmacy and psychology, have produced two sets of guidelines which will be continually revised as new evidence emerges. It is supported by Diabetes UK, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and NHS England."
