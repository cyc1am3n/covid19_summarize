summary:
- "Africa has struggled to maintain a sustainable safe blood supply prior to the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on an already fragile blood supply could result in devastating consequences for obstetric patients. Application of the principles of Patient Blood Management has previously been recommended. These cost effective and safe principles should be applied with urgency in Africa in an attempt to reduce maternal mortality in the wake of the COVD-19 pandemie."

original:
- "As we face the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of blood and components are a global concern. Yet Africa has struggled to maintain a sustainable safe blood supply prior to the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on an already fragile blood supply could result in devastating consequences for obstetric patients, adding to the burden of maternal mortality on the African continent. Application of the principles of Patient Blood Management in the obstetric population has previously been recommended. In the light of the COVD-19 pandemic, these cost effective and safe principles should be applied with urgency in Africa in an attempt to reduce maternal mortality in the wake of the pandemic."
