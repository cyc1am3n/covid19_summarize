summary:
- "Otolaryngologists represent a subset of healthcare workers uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. Methods Guidelines published by international and U.S. governing bodies were reviewed to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers. High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head. and neck instrumentation are lacking. Extrapolation of recommendations suggests strongly that head & neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions."

original:
- "Background Otolaryngologists represent a subset of healthcare workers uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. Given the segmentation of extant guidelines concerning precautions and protective equipment for SARS-CoV2, we aimed to provide consolidated recommendations regarding appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in head neck surgery during the COVID-19 era. Methods Guidelines published by international and United States governing bodies were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients. Results High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking. However, extrapolation of recommendations by governing bodies suggest strongly that head and neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions. Conclusion We present a series of situation-specific recommendations for PPE use and other procedural precautions for otolaryngology providers to consider in the COVID-19 era.
