summary:
- "Glucose control helps prevent and control infections and their complications. For critically ill patients with COVID-19, management of hyperglycemia must consider caregiver protection and the frequency of monitoring glucose based on patient safety and personal protective equipment. An endocrinology consult may be beneficial to help manage drip rate and frequency of glucose checks. If steroids are used in the management plan, be aware of steroid-induced hypergycemia."

original:
- "Hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients and is associated with worse outcomes in those admitted to an intensive care unit. Glucose control helps prevent and control infections and their complications. For critically ill patients with COVID-19, management of hyperglycemia must consider caregiver protection and the frequency of monitoring glucose based on patient safety and the use of personal protective equipment. If steroids are used in the management plan, be aware of steroid-induced hyperglycemia. An endocrinology consult may be beneficial to help manage drip rate and frequency of glucose checks."
