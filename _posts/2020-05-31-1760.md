title: "Measuring weight with e-scales in clinical and research settings during the COVID-19 pandemic"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22851"
author:
- Krukowski, Rebecca A.; Ross, Kathryn M.

summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid adoption of telehealth methodologies. Clinicians and researchers focused on obesity management have an additional need-- a remote way to measure weight. In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement escales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight."

original:
- "With the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been suddenly confronted with the difficulty of treatment provision and continuation of clinical trials without face-to-face contact. This predicament has resulted in the rapid adoption of telehealth methodologies.1 Clinicians and researchers focused on obesity management have an additional need-- a remote way to measure weight. In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement e-scales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight."
