summary:
- "COVID-19 is overshadowing society across the world. It will redefine many aspects of how we live and work in the future. In a crisis, people are rightly looking for solutions from their leaders and experts. The pandemic takes years from discovery to approval, but drug development is on a fundamentally different timeline. Currently, drug development has a different timeline for drug development and therapy."

original:
- "COVID-19 is overshadowing society across the world and it will redefine many aspects of how we live and work in the future. In a crisis, people are rightly looking for solutions from their leaders and experts and their response and actions will define them for years to come. COVID-19 may also be such a defining moment for clinical pharmacology in terms of its role in drug development and therapy. Though most drug development takes years from discovery to approval, for the COVID-19 pandemic, drug development is on a fundamentally different timeline."
