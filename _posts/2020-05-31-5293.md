summary:
- "testing for SARS-CoV-2 is resource intensive. We report an innovative approach to home assessment that enables safe evaluation and specimen collection outside the healthcare setting. Thousands of people in the U.S. have required testing for a special pathogen. The pathogen is a pathogen with a unique pathogen, SARS - CoV-2. Testing for the pathogen has been a resource intensive process."
