summary:
- "Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms. Most common characteristics on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%) The most common findings were lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (94.7%) The prevalence of anti-52 kDa SSA/Ro antibody and antinuclear antibody in the cases was 20%, 25% and 50% respectively. A total of 21 patients had laboratory-confirmed severe cases) were dominant symptoms, and most of them (76."

original:
- "We aimed to report the clinical and autoimmune characteristics of severe and critical novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. The clinical, autoimmune, and laboratory characteristics of 21 patients who had laboratory-confirmed severe and critical cases of COVID-19 from the intensive care unit (ICU) ward of the Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China were investigated. A total of 21 patients (13 males and eight females) including eight (38.1%) severe cases and 13 (61.9%) critical cases were enrolled. Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most of them (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission. The most common characteristics on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%). The most common findings on laboratory measurements were lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (94.7%), and Interleukin-6 (89.5%). The prevalence of anti-52 kDa SSA/Ro antibody, anti-60 kDa SSA/Ro antibody and antinuclear antibody in the cases was 20%, 25% and 50% respectively. In the present work, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data from 21 severe and critical cases with COVID-19. Autoimmune phenomena exist in COVID-19 subjects, and the results provide the rationale for a strategy of prevention of dysfunction of immune and optimal immunosuppressive therapy in the future."
