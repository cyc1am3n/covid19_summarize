summary:
- "all admitted neonates should be isolated in a neonatal intensive care unit. All high-risk patients should receive a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. Admitting all neonates with COVID-19 to the NICU could ensure availability of close monitoring and necessary interventions. Each clinical setting should consider its bed surge capacity in case of a COV-19 outbreak and adopt a flexible and variable approach to admitting patients."

original:
- "We thank Daniele De Luca for his reflections on our Comment.1 We agree that testing all admitted neonates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not necessary. We recommended screening all newly admitted infants at high risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of their family history. Only high-risk patients should receive a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. However, all high-risk neonates should be isolated in a single room, preferably in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Based on existing experience, some patients initially present with mild flu-like symptoms but rapidly develop respiratory distress and multiple organ failure. Admitting all neonates with COVID-19 to the NICU could ensure the availability of close monitoring and necessary interventions.2 However, each clinical setting should consider its bed surge capacity in case of a COVID-19 outbreak and adopt a flexible and variable approach to admitting patients. We recommend an individualised treatment strategy in the management of patients with COVID-19. The pathological findings from a patient who died from COVID-19 are consistent with the histological rationale for neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),3 , 4 indicating the probability of secondary impairment of surfactant function and pulmonary hypertension in the case of severe neonatal COVID-19. Therefore, surfactant administration and inhaled nitric oxide are expected to be effective in infants with severe COVID-19. We agree with the recommendation that a physiology-based ventilation method should be used and that extracorporeal life support should only be provided as a rescue approach."
