summary:
- "a 42-year-old lady with end-stage renal disease from lupus nephritis had failed peritoneal dialysis due to pleuro-peritonea leak and failed vascular access creation due to early thrombosis. The transplant from her husband was ABO-incompatible and had positive B cell flow crossmatch with multiple donor-specific antibodies. Priority access to deceased donors is limited and unpredictable."

original:
- "We describe the challenges of performing a high-immunological risk living donor renal transplant during the COVID-19 outbreak. A 42-year-old lady with end-stage renal disease from lupus nephritis had failed peritoneal dialysis due to pleuro-peritoneal leak, failed vascular access creation due to early thrombosis and had recurrent dialysis catheter malfunction. The transplant from her husband was ABO-incompatible and had positive B cell flow crossmatch with multiple donor-specific antibodies. Neither alternative donors nor paired exchange candidates were available. Priority access to deceased donors is limited and unpredictable."
