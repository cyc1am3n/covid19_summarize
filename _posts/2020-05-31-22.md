summary:
- "two strategies could be part of the solution, but yet to be developed into a recognised protocol. Sorting patients free of COVID-19 from those who carry the disease. Low risk patients would then be tested in the dental setting to confirm that they do not have the virus. An agreed standard infection control protocol could subsequently be adopted without the need for a full-face respirator. The standard protocol could eventually be adopted. It could be subsequently adopted without a need for the use of a respirator to control the spread of the disease to reduce risk of transmission. One strategy could be developed."

original:
- "Sir, whist we wait for a vaccine to control the spread of COVID-19 we need to be thinking about ways to reduce risk of transmission. Two strategies could be part of the solution, albeit yet to be developed into a recognised protocol: sorting patients and saliva testing. Sorting patients free of COVID-19 from those who carry the disease, so that the majority of patients can safely return for dental treatment, might involve telephone triage to assess the risk before offering low risk patients an appointment. Low risk patients would then be tested in the dental setting to confirm that they do not have the virus. An agreed standard infection control protocol could subsequently be adopted without the need for a full-face respirator. "
