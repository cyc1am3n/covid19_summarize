summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) is the cause of COVID19. Cardiovascular disease is most commonly found. Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients who require ICU care. Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists."

original:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). The most common symptoms of COVID19 are: fever (81.8%-100%), cough (46.3%-86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%-50%), expectoration (4.4%-72%), and dyspnea (18.6%-59%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in COVID19 include decreased lymphocyte count (35%-82.1%), thrombocytopenia (17%-36.2%), elevated serum Creactive protein (60.7%-93%), lactate dehydrogenase (41%-76%), and Ddimer concentrations (36%-46.4%). Among comorbidities in patients with COVID19, cardiovascular disease is most commonly found. In addition, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases have worse prognosis and more often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients without such comorbidities. It is estimated that about 20% of patients with COVID19 develop cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients with COVID19 who require ICU care. In a group of critically ill patients, 27.5% had an elevated Nterminal pro-Btype natriuretic peptide concentration, and increased cardiac troponin level was found in 10% of patients. One of the lifethreatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement. Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases. So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID19 are limited. Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists. Thus, it is important to know typical COVID19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment."
