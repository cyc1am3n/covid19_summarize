original:
- "Preliminary clinical features indicated that most of the infected patients were men with underlying diseases (comorbidities) including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease[6]. Patient presented with fever, cough, myalgia, sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, diarrhea and dyspnea[6]. Person- to-person transmission and familiar association have also been confirmed[7]. To date, a diagnostic kit has been developed for 2019- nCoV[8], and efforts are ongoing to develop other protocols. Whilst several important aspects of 2019-nCoV epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, have been defined, there remain many unanswered questions, including source, transmission and epidemic potential. The Wuhan outbreak is a stark reminder of the continuing threat of zoonotic diseases."
