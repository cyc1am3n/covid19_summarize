summary:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection. Hydroxychloroquine and chlorine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19. There is also concern for harm, particularly QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. We call for additional randomized controlled trial evidence prior to the widespread incorporation of hydroxychloroquin and chloroquiine into national and international treatment guidelines."

original:
- "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 following several small clinical trials, uncontrolled case series, and public figure endorsements. While there is a growing body of scientific data, there is also concern for harm, particularly QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we perform a rapid narrative review and discuss the strengths and limitations of existing in vitro and clinical studies. We call for additional randomized controlled trial evidence prior to the widespread incorporation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into national and international treatment guidelines."
