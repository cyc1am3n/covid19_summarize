summary:
- "the pandemic of COVID-19 has placed an enormous burden on health authorities across the world. The virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), causes acute respiratory disease with common signs of infection being respiratory symptoms, fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection causes pneumonia, lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death."

original:
- "We read with interest the article in this journal which revealed the critical role of timely supply of medical resources for COVID-19 patients.1 The pandemic of COVID-19 has placed an enormous burden on health authorities across the world. The virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), causes acute respiratory disease with common signs of infection being respiratory symptoms, fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection causes pneumonia, lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death. The WHO reports that 80% of those infected will develop mild symptoms, 14% severe symptoms and 6% will become critically ill. Given the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19, a key challenge faced by frontline clinical staff is prioritisation of stretched resources. Thus, there is a critical need for robust risk assessment for clinical management. To address this, we identified consecutive patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 discharged from the general wards of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 5 February 2020 to 14 March 2020 (Ethics approval No: WDRY2020-K124). All patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance and had radiologic evidence of pneumonia or infiltrates on chest CT scan according. The criteria for patient discharge was the absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs on chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for viral RNA obtained at least 24 hours apart. In total, 99 patients (61 pneumonia and 38 severe pneumonia) with key information in their medical records were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records. Risk factors that affect disease severity and length of hospital stay were investigated with appropriate statistical methods using R (V3.6.1) or GraphPad Prism (V8.2.1)."
