summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen after a median of 31 days (IQR: 29-36 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrates sparse expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with almost no overlapping gene expression. Short-term effects on male reproductive function remain unknown. Results Six patients demonstrated scrotal discomfort concerning for viral orchitis around the time of COVId-19 confirmation."

original:
- "Objective To describe detection of SARS-CoV-2 in seminal fluid of patients recovering from COVID-19 and describe the expression profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 within the testicle. Design observational, cross-sectional study Setting Tertiary referral center Patients Thirty-four adult Chinese males diagnosed with COVID-19 through confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab samples Intervention None Main Outcome Measures Identification of SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR of single ejaculated semen samples. Semen quality was not assessed. Expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human testis are explored through previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets. Results Six patients (19%) demonstrated scrotal discomfort concerning for viral orchitis around the time of COVID-19 confirmation. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen after a median of 31 days (IQR: 29-36 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrates sparse expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with almost no overlapping gene expression. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the semen of patients recovering from COVID-19 one month after COVID-19 diagnosis. ACE2-mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells is unlikely to occur within the human testicle based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function remain unknown."
