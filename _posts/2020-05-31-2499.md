summary:
- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 has become one of the worst pandemics of our time that has already caused more than 183.470 deaths($) Effective therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce the spread of the virus and its death toll. We assess the possibility of using interferon lambda (IFN??) for treating COVID-19 patients. IFN?? is a promising therapeutic agent for reducing viral presence and hyperinflammation in a single shot."

original:
- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), triggered by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become one of the worst pandemics of our time that has already caused more than 183.470 deaths($) [CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE IT A FOOTNOTE? ($) JHU data-23/04/2020, https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6].. Effective therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce the spread of the virus and its death toll. Here, we assess the possibility of using interferon lambda (IFN??), a third type of interferon sharing low homology with type I IFNs and IL-10, for treating COVID-19 patients. We discuss the unique role of IFN?? in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may impair IFN?? induction, leading to a delayed type I IFN-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease. We also consider the potential windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention with IFN?? and potential safety considerations. We conclude that IFN?? constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for reducing viral presence and hyperinflammation in a single shot to prevent the devastating consequences of COVID-19 such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
