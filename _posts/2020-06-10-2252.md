summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread. There have been multiple reports of superspreading events (SSEs) SSEs are associated with both explosive growth early in an outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. Prevention and mitigation depends on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings. Identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control."

original:
- "It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread. Although we still have limited information on the epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. Although SSEs appear to be difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends, first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings. Better understanding transmission dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future infectious disease outbreaks."
