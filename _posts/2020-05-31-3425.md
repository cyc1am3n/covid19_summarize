original:
- "Inspired and hopeful! Those words describe how I feel after seeing worldwide and AFS member response to coronavirus. The pandemic is of course devastating, but some good things are collateral results of a world shifting gears. The kindness, hard work and decency of people including fisheries professionals are on full display. AFS members and staff are staying at home and social distancing. I see them working together to put on virtual fisheries conferences. I observe AFS staff making extremely hard decisions about budget adjustments, many of which affect their personal wellbeing, to keep AFS financially healthy."
