summary:
- "we estimate the distribution of serial intervals for 468 confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus disease reported in China as of February 8, 2020. The mean interval was 3.96 days (95% CI 3.53-4.39 days), SD 4.75 days. 12.6% of case reports indicated presymptomatic transmission. We estimate a distribution of the serial interval. 468 cases were confirmed in China by February 8. Figures are based on the number of confirmed cases."
