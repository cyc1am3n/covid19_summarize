- "COVID-19 outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work. Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed. Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment. We hope that our experience in prevention and control can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread. Infection control specialists should collaborate."

Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases. Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed.
