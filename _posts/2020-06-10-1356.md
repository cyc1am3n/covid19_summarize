summary:
- "virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is 125?nm. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020."

original:
- "The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125?nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is >?96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1].ID - Fisher2020 As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus."
