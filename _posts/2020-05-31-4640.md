summary:
- "a recent JAMA viewpoint failed to mention obesity as one of the pre-existing diseases associated with death. The rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H1N1 Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients. In the US, the rise in obesity prevalence in the U.S. is likely to account for the differences in mortality between the two countries."

- "A recent JAMA viewpoint regarding fatalities In Italy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic failed to mention obesity as one of the pre-existing diseases associated with death.1 It seems likely that the increased prevalence of obesity in Italy older adults compared to China may account for the differences in mortality between the two countries. Furthermore, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H1N1 Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients."
