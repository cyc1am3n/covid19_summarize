summary:
- "the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced the fear and disorder inevitably provoked by emerging pathogens. As with HIV, the road to reducing infections requires medical and nonmedical strategies. The most important lesson learned from tackling HIV is to use combination of prevention strategies, he says. Using prevention strategies is the best way to reduce infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome. HIV should also inspire consideration of our experience with HIV over the past 40 years."

As such, it should also inspire consideration of our experience with HIV over the past 40 years. As with HIV, the road to reducing infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19), and attendant morbidity and mortality, requires medical and nonmedical strategies. The most important lesson learned from tackling HIV is to use a combination of prevention strategies."
