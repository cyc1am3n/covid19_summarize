summary:
- "Regulatory agencies around the world have responded to the need to improve medical workforce capacity in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, a growing number of American states have taken measures to waive or expedite licensure for inactive or retired medical licensees. Some late career doctors are anxious about their risk and are understandably choosing now to retire. A range of models has been developed, which vary according to jurisdiction and are evolving on an ongoing basis."

original:
- "A call for action to come back and join the fight against COVID-19 has been issued to retired doctors around the world (CBS news, 2020). Many have responded to this call and have returned, or will return to the workforce. Conversely, some late career doctors who are in practice are anxious about their risk and are understandably choosing now to retire.

Returning to the profession Regulatory agencies around the world have responded to the need to improve medical workforce capacity in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, a growing number of American states have taken measures to waive or expedite licensure for inactive or retired medical licensees (FSMB, 2020). A range of models has been developed. These vary according to jurisdiction and are evolving on an ongoing basis. While not all regulatory agencies initially favoured relicensing, with the fluidity and urgency of the situation more states are easing requirements for licensure at both the early and late career stages (FSMB, 2020)."
