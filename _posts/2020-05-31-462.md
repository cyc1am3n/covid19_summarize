summary:
- "COVID patients in ICU present high mortality rate and immunoprofiling reveals heterogeneous production of IFN-alpha2. About 20% of critically-ill patients unable to produce IFN. highlighting the immune response heterogenity and opening avenues for targeted therapies. COVD patients present a low mortality rate. Historians in IUC present high-risk patients with high mortality rates. Immunprofilation reveals a higher mortality rate with about 20% unable. to produce. patients present high ICU a high mortality. about 20 per cent of critically ill patients in."
