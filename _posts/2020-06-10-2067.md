original:
- "COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronavirus, has changed clinical practice in a matter of weeks. Among the physician specialties, respiratory physicians have been at the forefront of the response to this new challenge. Here we provide advice for non-respiratory physicians on the ward-based care of patients with this disease. This includes recommendations on hydration, thromboprophylaxis, nutritional support and on the importance of the early detection of deterioration, setting ceilings of care and use of anticipatory drugs where appropriate. We also discuss oxygen support modalities, proning, safe working practices and a new approach to multi-professional working. We include references to a number of important research studies."
