summary:
- "During COVID-19 outbreak there are discordant opinion towards the impact on biologics in psoriatic patients. We enrolled 1193 PsO patients treated with biologics and small molecules. The entire Lombardia population used the entire population as controls. No Pso patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or died. During the outbreak there were no increased risk of ICU admission or death. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

original:
- "During COVID-19 outbreak there are discordant opinion towards the impact on biologics in psoriatic patients. Thus we performed a single center case-control study in Lombardia, the Italian region with the higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. We enrolled 1193 PsO patients treated with biologics and small molecules and we used the entire Lombardia population as controls. Notably, 17 PsO patients COVID-19 confirmed were quarantined at home and 5 hospitalized, no PsO patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or died. With respect to the general population of Lombardy, patients on biologics were at higher risk to be symptomatic for COVID-19 (OR 3.43 [95%CI 2.25-5.73], P??< 0.0001), to be self-quarantined at home (OR 9.05 [95%CI 5.61-14.61], P??< 0.0001) and hospitalized (OR 3.59 [95%CI 1.49-8.63], P??= 0.0044) however not increased risk of ICU admission or death were found. PsO Patients on biologics should be carefully monitored with telemedicine during COVID-19 outbreak and early treated at home to limit hospital overwhelm. This article is protected by copyright.
