summary:
- "individuals held in state psychiatric facilities tend to become the forgotten clients of the mental health system. The same approaches that can protect those served in the community mental health sector during a public health crisis likely do not translate well to locked wards in state hospitals. National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors has issued recommendations for assisting individuals in state facilities during the novel coronavirus crisis. NASMHPD has therefore issued recommendations."
