title: "Global Crisis Leadership for Disease-Induced Threats: One Health and Urbanisation"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12806"
author:

summary:
- "the concept of 'One Health? (OH) has gathered momentum among public health and animal health communities as an important global policy agenda. OH research is generally concerned with preventative programmes that can minimise the threats posed by diseases at the animal-human interface. This article discusses the multi-level challenges of establishing OH with a particular focus on urban change. The article concludes by discussing why social scientists need to pay greater attention to the concept."

original:
- "The concept of ?One Health? (OH) has gathered momentum among the public health and animal health communities as an important global policy agenda for drawing together these disciplines to inform urban planning and health security policies. OH research, from a risk governance perspective, is generally concerned with identifying preventative programmes that can minimise the threats posed by diseases at the animal-human interface (e.g. Corona virus, Ebola, avian influenza, the Q virus, for example). This article, by drawing on examples of disease threats, discusses the multi-level challenges of establishing OH with a particular focus on urban change. It considers the risks posed by the increasing urbanisation of animal habitats and what this means for achieving OH. The article concludes by discussing why social scientists need to pay greater attention to the concept of OH."
