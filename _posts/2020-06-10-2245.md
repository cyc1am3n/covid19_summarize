summary:
- "people with Down syndrome show signs of chronic immune dysregulation. They show markers of chronic autoinflammation, including interferon hyperactivity, elevated levels of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The impact of this immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 remains unknown. This perspective will outline why individuals with Down Syndrome should be considered an at-risk population for severe COVId-19. Specifically, the impact of a exacerbated cytokine release syndrome may result in higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders. Down syndrome."

original:
- "<h2>Summary</h2><p>People with Down syndrome show signs of chronic immune dysregulation, including higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders, increased rates of hospitalization during respiratory viral infections, and higher mortality rates from pneumonia and sepsis. At the molecular and cellular levels, they show markers of chronic autoinflammation, including interferon hyperactivity, elevated levels of many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and changes in diverse immune cell types reminiscent of inflammatory conditions observed in the general population. However, the impact of this immune dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 remains unknown. This Perspective will outline why individuals with Down syndrome should be considered an at-risk population for severe COVID-19. Specifically, the immune dysregulation caused by trisomy 21 may result in an exacerbated cytokine release syndrome relative to that observed in the euploid population, thus justifying additional monitoring and specialized care for this vulnerable population.</p>"
