summary:
- "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic of infectious disease. Prevention of infection and spread is critical in preventing morbidity and mortality. Prophylaxis is particularly critical to breaking the spread and rapid rate of increase of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-malarial agents, specifically the 4-aminoquinolones, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquin, are needed components of this public health measure."

original:
- "With the ongoing pandemic of infectious disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C0V-2), prevention of infection and spread is critical in preventing morbidity and mortality. Prophylaxis, specifically chemoprophylaxis, is particularly critical to breaking the spread and rapid rate of increase of SARS-CoV-2. Pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis are both required components of this public health measure. As the use of anti-malarial agents, specifically the 4-aminoquinolones, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is now being reported, attention must be turned to their role in the chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2. In a search of the peer-reviewed medical literature (using MEDLINE and cross-referenced literature), this report is first peer-reviewed publication to present the use of these anti-malarial agents as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. The ophthalmic consideration of the use of these drugs is highlighted in this report."
