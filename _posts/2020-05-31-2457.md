summary:
- "the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought both systemic, practice changes and limitations to social workers' commitment to the welfare of vulnerable populations such as older people. kinship care practices are culturally engrained within jurisdictions such as Ghana. Social workers should promote support as substitute mechanisms and pathways to safeguard or meet the welfare needs of older people, says a golden preventive rule. In jurisdictions like Ghana, social workers must promote support for older people who are considered as an at-risk population."

original:
- "Undoubtedly, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought both systemic, practice changes and limitations to social workers' commitment to the welfare of vulnerable populations such as older people. A golden preventive rule of the COVID-19 pandemic; maintaining physical and social distancing, has limited social workers' direct practice support for older people who are considered as an at-risk population. Within jurisdictions such as Ghana where kinship care practices are culturally engrained, social workers should promote kinship care support as substitute mechanisms and pathways to safeguard or meet the welfare needs of older people."
