summary:
- "Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death remains to be investigated. Whether NLR can be a predictor, a study will be carried out in China. The study is expected to be conducted by the end of the year. Clinical characteristics of COVID-infective patients. study. Study."
