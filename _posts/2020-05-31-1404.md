summary:
- "COVID-19 patients with lung cancer have a higher risk of severe events than patients without cancer. Lung cancer patients in each age stage, subtype, and pathological stage are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the primitive subtype of LUSC. Results are unanimous on tissue expression in gene and protein levels. LUAD patients are more susceptible to infection than LUCS patients. Recent studies have reported a high risk of serious events."

original:
- "Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 patients with lung cancer have a higher risk of severe events than patients without cancer. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Lung cancer patients in each age stage, subtype, and pathological stage are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the primitive subtype of LUSC. LUAD patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than LUSC patients. The findings are unanimous on tissue expression in gene and protein levels."
