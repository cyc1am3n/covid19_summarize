summary:
- "Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer. This is a site-specific mass spectrometric approach. We show how the gens on a recombinant viral spike differ from typical host. The emergence of the betacoronavirus, COVID-19, represents a significant threat to global human health is focusing on the main target of a viral response, which mediates cell entry and membrane fusion."

- "The emergence of the betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, represents a significant threat to global human health. Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycan-processing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design."
