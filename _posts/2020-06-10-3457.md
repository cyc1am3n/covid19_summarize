summary:
- "a recent study in China showed that transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. This is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified. Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. We discuss the conclusion of the conclusion. The first time that the relative transmission of COVD-19 infection was quantified is questioned."

- "Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic. A recent study in China showed that transmissibility of the asymptomatic cases is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified."
