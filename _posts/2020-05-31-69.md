original:
- "We read with great interest the publication of Messina et al 1 reporting the first case of SARS-CoV2 infection in a young patient of 32-year-old suffering from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treated by Guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets specifically the p19 subunit of Interleukin (IL)-232.The patient contracted the SARS-CoV2 infection after a dinner with some friends but fortunately she developed very discrete symptoms including only mild fever and rhinorrhea. These findings support the potential role of IL-23p19 inhibitors to counteract the ????cytokine storm???? triggered by the SARS-CoV2 and which is potentially implicated in the severity of the symptoms 3."
