summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course. The median time from exposure to diagnosis was 7.0 days (IQR 1.0-15.0 days) Of the 15 patients, 14 patients were diagnosed by tested positive. Only 1 (6.7%) patient developed lymphopenia during hospitalization. Abnormalities of chest CT examinations were detected in 8 (53.4%) patients on admission. As of March 8, 2020, all patients have been discharged."

original:
- "Few studies reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course. We investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 without any symptoms. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively recruited. The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed. Fifteen (4.4%) of 342 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients did not develop any symptom during the course of the disease. The median time from exposure to diagnosis was 7.0 days (IQR 1.0-15.0 days). Of the 15 patients, 14 patients were diagnosed by tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, while 1 patient was only tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in anal swabs. During hospitalization, only 1 (6.7%) patient developed lymphopenia. Abnormalities of chest CT examinations were detected in 8 (53.4%) patients on admission. As of March 8, 2020, all patients have been discharged. The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR 4.0-9.0 days). Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection. Asymptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have favorable outcomes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
