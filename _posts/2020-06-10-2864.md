summary:
- "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of one household. The complete genomes of the patients were &amp;gt;99.9% identical. We report a three-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight (53%) of 15 members from three families were confirmed with SARS. Asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son and a father transmitted it to his three-month-old daughter. Data about the transmission of the virus are lacking. Three-family infection is reported in a household in three families."

We report a three-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight (53%) of 15 members from three families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of eight patients, three were asymptomatic and one was paucisymptomatic. An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his three-month-old daughter. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of one household. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were &amp;gt;99.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries."
