summary:
- "Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the hardest-hit region, with a rise in confirmed cases. On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions. It is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety."

original:
- "An outbreak of the so-called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly nationwide in China since December 2019. Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the hardest-hit region, with a rise in confirmed cases and its hospitals overwhelmed. On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The mobile modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions, and there are complete equipment and specialized personnel to treat patients. Due to the severity and particularity of SARS-CoV-2, taking granted from lessons learnt from mobile modular hospitals, we use the existing large venues to construct a new fixed modular hospital. As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety. The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth. This paper mainly discusses how to construct the clinical laboratory in the modular hospital quickly and safely and put it into use to provide testing service for patients under various limited conditions."
