summary:
- "transcription of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected. Two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codions can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Analysis of host-specific slow codone and slow di codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and virus replication in host cells."

original:
- "Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses."
