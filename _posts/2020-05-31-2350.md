title: "COVID-19 - does exercise prescription and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) have a role in risk-stratifying patients?"

summary:
- "'high risk' patients will be at risk of significantly reducing physical activity levels. We explore evidence base for COVID-19-specific recommendations and exercise interventions to 'precondition' patients prior to infection. VO2 max has the potential to be used as a clinically relevant triage tool during the outbreak. The UK enforces social distancing measures to prevent deconditioning. Structured exercise programmes can be used to maintain physical activity level. This is a risk-stratifying tool."

original:
- "As the UK shields 'high risk' patients and enforces social distancing measures, patients will be at risk of significantly reducing physical activity levels. We explore the evidence base for COVID-19-specific recommendations and exercise interventions to 'precondition' patients prior to infection and appraise the role of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) as a risk-stratifying triage tool. We conclude that structured exercise programmes can be used to maintain physical activity levels and prevent deconditioning and that VO2 max has the potential to be used as a clinically relevant triage tool during the COVID-19 outbreak."
