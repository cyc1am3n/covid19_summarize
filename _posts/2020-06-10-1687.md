original:
- "The World Health Organization (WHO), on March 11(th) 2020, upgraded the status of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from epidemic to pandemic. Over two million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and as of April, 14(th) 2020, there were over 5000 confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia (SA). Many countries, including SA, have imposed major restrictions on travel, and everyday life, and the implications of these necessary changes are being felt in liver transplant (LT) centers in SA. Concerns remain that there is an increased risk for individuals over 65 years of age, with underlying medical conditions, or for those who are immunocompromised. Therefore, the Saudi Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Transplantation (SASLT) established an urgent task force to launch a statement that can be utilized by LT centers as a guidance in the management of patients with advanced liver disease from the time of LT listing to the post-operative care of transplanted patients."
