summary:
- "Transplant programmes are being scaled back as healthcare systems respond to COVID-19. Most centres are now taking only super urgent and urgent cases. Management of donor organs is also impacted. Contingency protocols may prioritise distance over equitable sharing principles. Live and deceased donation is either being selectively paused or operating under stringent criteria based on local capacity. This will inevitably lead to variable patient experience. Transplant programs are now scaling back."

Management of donor organs is also impacted. Contingency protocols may prioritise distance over equitable sharing principles. Live and deceased donation is either being selectively paused or operating under stringent criteria based on local capacity. This will inevitably lead to variable patient experience."
