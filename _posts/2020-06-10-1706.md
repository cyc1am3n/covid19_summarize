summary:
- "A prospective interventional case series study was performed. 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctionitis yielded positive RT-PCR results."

- "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. At an interval of 2-3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. 58 samples from other patents were all negative. CONCLUSION: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
