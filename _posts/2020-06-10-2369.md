summary:
- "this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service. Clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices. Results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation. In particular, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform. Using the blockchain technology, the cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the need of telehealthcare service becomes fundamental to reduce the risk of pandemics due to the Covid-19 virus."

original:
- "In a pandemic situation such as that we are living at the time of writing of this paper due to the Covid-19 virus, the need of tele-healthcare service becomes dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, thence reducing the risk of infection. Leveraging the recent Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service where clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices and results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation. In particular, we discuss a distributed scenario where nurses, technicians and medical doctors belonging to different hospitals cooperate through their federated hospital Clouds to form a virtual health team able to carry out a healthcare workflow in secure fashion leveraging the intrinsic security features of the Blockchain technology. In particular, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform."
