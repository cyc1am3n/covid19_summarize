summary:
- "the current COVID-19 pandemic inherits an unprecedented challenge for the treating rheumatologists. Antirheumatic drugs can increase the risk of infection and potentially deteriorate the course of an infection. In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology, it is recommended that our patients continue the antirhumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity. Over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rhematologist to continue the therapy."

original:
- "The current COVID-19 pandemic inherits an unprecedented challenge for the treating rheumatologists. On the one hand, antirheumatic drugs can increase the risk of infection and potentially deteriorate the course of an infection. On the other hand, an active inflammatory rheumatic disease can also increase the risk for an infection. In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology (www.dgrh.de), it is recommended that our patients continue the antirheumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity despite the pandemic. In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy. The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only asmall percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own. This result was independent of the individual anti-rheumatic therapy. Taken together, the results of this study illustrate not only the trustful patient-physician partnership in athreatening situation but also the high impact of state-of-the art recommendations by the respective scientific society."
