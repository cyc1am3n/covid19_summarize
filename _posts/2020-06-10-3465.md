summary:
- "there is no evidence of SARS-CoV2 particles in the gas used during laparoscopy. Safety strategies are needed to avoid diffusion of potentially infected intrabdominal aerosol in operating room. It is prudent to perform laparoscopic surgery with safety strategies. There is no indication of hepatitis virus. there is a risk of fluorescence in the operating room of the gas."

original:
- "Even if previous studies on HBV showed that hepatitis virus could be found in the intrabdominal gas, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV2 particles in the gas used during laparoscopy so far, but it is prudent to perform laparoscopy with safety strategies to avoid diffusion of potentially infected intrabdominal aerosol in the operating room."
