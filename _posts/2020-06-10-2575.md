summary:
- "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-coV-2 in posterior oropharyngal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses from patients."

original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses."
