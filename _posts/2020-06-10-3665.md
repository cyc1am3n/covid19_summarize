summary:
- "the demand for chest imaging will inevitably rise with an accompanying increase in risk of disease transmission to frontline radiology staff. Radiology departments should implement strict infection control measures and robust operational plans to minimise disease transmission and mitigate potential impact of possible staff infection. The authors share several operational guidelines and strategies implemented in our practice to reduce spread of COVID-19 while maintaining clinical and educational needs of a teaching hospital. In this article, authors share some operational strategies and guidelines to reduce the spread of the disease. They share several strategies to reduce risk of chest imaging is expected to rise with a rise in risk to front line radiology."
