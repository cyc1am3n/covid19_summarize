summary:
- "the COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to our National Health Service. There will be a knee-jerk tendency to cancel all outpatient activity by NHS trusts. The need to appropriately direct all efforts towards providing emergency supportive care to those suffering will be an unmet cost to those patients who are high-risk and are already on the cancer referral pathway. This seems a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission, but there will be unmet costs to those who are low-risk."

As the need to appropriately direct all efforts towards providing emergency supportive care to those suffering, there will be a knee-jerk tendency to cancel all outpatient activity by NHS trusts. Whilst this appears to be a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission, there will be an unmet cost to those patients who are high-risk and are already on the cancer referral pathway."
