summary:
- "COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers. Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females. Using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors may be one of the factors contributing to poorer sex-dependent difference in disease outcomes. Men have 65% higher mortality rate. Long term observational studies will confirm improved recovery in females, he says."

original:
- "COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers. Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females. Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males. Background With increasing number of COVID-19 cases, an evident sex- dependent difference in disease outcomes can be observed. Based on published studies with short term follow-up, males have 65% higher mortality rate (1). The question remains, whether long term observational studies will confirm improved recovery in females."
