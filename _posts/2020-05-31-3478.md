summary:
- "the current COVID-19 crisis continues to grow and has resulted in marked changes to clinical operations. Radiology researchers are currently grappling with these challenges that will continue to affect current and future imaging research. The acute response at six distinct institutions will first be described, exploring common themes, challenges, priorities, and practices. This article will describe the collective experiences of a diverse international group of academic radiology research programs in managing their response. In parallel with clinical preparedness, universities have shut down the majority of scientific research activities. Radiology crisis has led to significant changes in clinical operations continue to grow."

The purpose of this article is to describe the collective experiences of a diverse international group of academic radiology research programs in managing their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The acute response at six distinct institutions will first be described, exploring common themes, challenges, priorities, and practices. This will be followed by reflections about the future of radiology research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."
