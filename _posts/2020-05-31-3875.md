summary:
- "in patients with COIVD-19, observation of peripheral blood film shows the presence of pronounced morhological anomalies of the granulocyte series. One week after the start of treatment, such anomalies subside, and an increasing proportion of reactive lymphocytes dominates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
