summary:
- "DPP4 inhibition may be a target for decreasing the risk of acute respiratory complications of the COVID-19 infection. It has been hypothesized that DPP4, a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes, might represent a risk factor for severity and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. The therapy is currently available to type 2 diabetics, but it isn't a plausible approach to mitigate the disease. Diabetes is a potential target for reducing the risk. Symptoms of sDPP4 inhibiting a treatment for the acute complications of COV."

- "Diabetes could be a risk factor for severity and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. It has been hypothesized that DPP4 inhibition, a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes, might represent a target for decreasing the risk of the acute respiratory complications of the COVID-19 infection but 1) lack of demonstration of SARS-CoV2 binding to DPP4 2) possible protective role of sDPP4 in Middle East respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV 3) demonstrated inhibition and downregulation of DPP4 by HIV1 and MERS-CoV and 4) not exclusive role of the receptor binding in tropism of the Coronavirus family, support that DPP4 inhibition at present doesn't represent a plausible approach to mitigate Covid-19."
