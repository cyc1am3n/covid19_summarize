summary:
- "Dr. Coto, Ruben, commented on the original SOFA score. We did not double-count the thrombopenia for sepsis-induced coagulopathy score [2] in practice. It's an obvious repetitive item in practice, it's a repetitive item. But we did not count the original score in practice; it isn't a repeatable SIC. Dr Coto's comment about the score was a remark."

original:
- "We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the comment about Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score by Dr. Coto, Ruben. We admit that we misquoted the original SOFA score including six items [1] in our paper. But we did not double-count the thrombopenia for sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score [2] in practice, it's an obvious repetitive item."
