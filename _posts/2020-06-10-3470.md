summary:
- "limited data are available regarding immunosuppression management in kidney transplant recipients. We report a case of a 32-year-old KTR who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and fully recovered in 15 days. The role of systemic inflammation is proving crucial in determining unfavorable outcome. Limited data available regarding SARS coV-2 pneumonia. KTRs are infected with SARS infection. A KTR developed the infection and recovered in a 15-day period."

Limited data are available regarding immunosuppression management in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We report a case of a 32-year-old KTR who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and fully recovered in 15 days while maintaining standard immunosuppressive therapy."
