Education about the role and science of such testing is critically important for programs to be effectively understood and managed. Testing for antibodies on an individual and societal scale could help drive evidence based decision-making. Students are concerned about how to appropriately begin to return to work and community activity in a safe and responsible manner."

original:
- "The orthopedic community has seen the COVID-19 pandemic decimate elective surgical volumes in most geographies. Patients and essential workers, such as healthcare providers, remain rightfully concerned about how to appropriately begin to return to work and community activity in a safe and responsible manner. Many believe that testing for the presence of antibodies on a widespread scale could help drive evidence-based decision making, both on an individual and societal scale. Much information, and an equal amount of misinformation, has been produced on antibody testing. Education about the role and science of such testing is critically important for programs to be effectively understood and managed."
