Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients. Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary Antimicrobial usage.

Prospective studies are needed, data from which can inform stewardship strategies and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.

original:
- "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arose at a time of great concern about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). No studies have specifically assessed COVID-19-associated superinfections or AMR. Based on limited data from case series, it is reasonable to anticipate that an appreciable minority of patients with severe COVID-19 will develop superinfections, most commonly pneumonia due to nosocomial bacteria and Aspergillus. Microbiology and AMR patterns are likely to reflect institutional ecology. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy. Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary antimicrobial use and AMR. Congressional COVID-19 relief bills are considering antimicrobial reimbursement reforms and antimicrobial subscription models, but it is unclear if these will be included in final legislation. Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development."
