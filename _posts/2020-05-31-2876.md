summary:
- "COVID-19, a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, has become a major public health problem worldwide. It affects the upper and lower respiratory tract in the majority of cases. Kidney involvement has been reported to be around 3-9% and the most common presentation is with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, the data is still preliminary. Further research is needed to understand the full spectrum of COVID-19 infection on kidney health. More research is required to understand full spectrum."

- "Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education: COVID-19, a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, has become a major public health problem worldwide. It principally affects the upper and lower respiratory tract in the majority of cases. In severe cases, it may involve multiple organs including the kidneys. Kidney involvement has been reported to be around 3-9% and the most common presentation is with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, the data is still preliminary. Data regarding COVID-19 virus affecting patients with prior kidney diseases are still rudimentary. Further research is needed to understand the full spectrum of COVID-19 infection on kidney health."
