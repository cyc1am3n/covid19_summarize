title: "COVID-19 admissions calculators: General population and paediatric cohort"
link: "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105043"
author:
- Grech, Victor

summary:
- "the world is in the grip of pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Children appear to be only mildly affected but for those countries that are still preparing for their first wave of infections, it is salutary to have some estimates with which to plan for eventual contingencies. These assessments would include acute hospital admission requirements, intensive care admissions and deaths per given population. This paper will create an interactive spreadsheet model to estimate population and paediatric admissions for a given population, with the author's country, Malta, the world's grip of Pandemic."

original:
- "The world is in the grip of pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Children appear to be only mildly affected but for those countries that are still preparing for their first wave of infections, it is salutary to have some estimates with which to plan for eventual contingencies. These assessments would include acute hospital admission requirements, intensive care admissions and deaths per given population. It is also useful to have an estimate of how many paediatric admissions to expect per given population. However it is only very recently that paediatric epidemiological data has become available. This paper will create an interactive spreadsheet model to estimate population and paediatric admissions for a given population, with the author's country, Malta, as a worked example for both."
