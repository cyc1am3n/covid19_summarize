summary:
- "the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organisation on 30 January 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to more countries worldwide. Nuclear medicine at Singapore General Hospital segregated staff and patients either by time, space or both. We made necessary changes to clinical practices and enforced strict infection control measures. During this period, our nuclear medicine segregated patients and staff to minimise contact and prevent the spread of the virus."

Since then, the virus has spread to affect more countries worldwide. During this period, our nuclear medicine at Singapore General Hospital segregated our staff and patients either by time, space, or both, to minimise contact and prevent the spread of the virus. We also made necessary changes to clinical practices and enforced strict infection control measures. We share our personal experience in managing a nuclear medicine department during this epidemic."
