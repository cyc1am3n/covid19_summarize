summary:
- "the British Oral and Maxillofacial (BAOMS) and oral surgeons (BAOS) have produced didactic guidance about risk and protection. This knowledge has been synthesised into position statements on NHS staff protection and working practice in the time of COVID-19. Among the findings is that health professionals are particularly susceptible to severe infections which reduces the active NHS workforce. They are particularly vulnerable to severe infection which, in combination with a lack of protective equipment, reduces active NHS workers."
